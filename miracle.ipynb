This is sometimes called the \"miracle of compound interest.\"  @fig-miracle-exponential shows the growth of an investment account earning 8% per year, which is what the U.S. stock market earned in real terms over the thirty year period 1992-2021.

        "Investments grow exponentially because they earn returns each year not just on the starting balance but also on all prior returns.  Exponential growth is much better than linear growth.  By \"linear growth,\" we mean that doubling the investment period would double the account growth.  Exponential is much better than that.  As can be seen from the figure, $1 would grow to slightly more than $3 in 15 years at 8% per year, so the growth in value is slightly more than $2.  Doubling the investment horizon to 30 years increases the growth to $9 (from $1 to $10), so the growth in value is more than four times larger when the horizon doubles, with an 8% return.   Because of exponential growth, it is incredibly important to invest early and to refrain from borrowing whenever possible (unless the borrowing finances the purchase of long-term assets).\n",
