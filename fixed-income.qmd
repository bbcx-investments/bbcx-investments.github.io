## Basic Concepts

### Spot Rates, Zero-Coupon Rates

A zero-coupon bond is a bond which doesn't pay any coupons. It is issued at a discount and at expiration date, the investor gets the face value (par value) back. Spot rate is the discount rate which makes the present value of a zero-coupon bond to its current market price.

We will use semi-annual compounding for most of this chapter. Let N be number of semi-annual periods, $C_{N}$ is the price of a zero-coupon bond with N semi-annual periods to maturity, $r_{N}$ is the N period spot rate.

Then we have: 
$$ Q_{N}= \frac{100}{(1+\frac{r_{N}}{2})^N}  $$ 

$r_{N}$ is the rate at which we should be using to discount cashflows from period N. If we know a collection of spot rate $r_{1}$, $r_{2}$...$r_{N}$, then we can price a bond with any cashflows by simply discounting each cashflow with the corresponding spot rate.
