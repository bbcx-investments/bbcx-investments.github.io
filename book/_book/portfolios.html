<p>Porfolios are combinations of underlying assets. In this chapter, we will explore the risk and return of portfolios and how we can form optimal portfolios. Our discussion will focus on the expected return and standard deviation of portfolio.</p>
<section id="portfolio-statistics" class="level2" data-number="4.1">
<h2 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="portfolio-statistics"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Portfolio Statistics</h2>
<section id="expected-return" class="level3" data-number="4.1.1">
<h3 data-number="4.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="expected-return"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Expected Return</h3>
<p>The expected return of a portfolio is simply the weighted sum of the expected returns of each asset in the portfolio, where the weights are fraction of capital invested in each asset:</p>
<p><span id="eq-port-expret-N"><span class="math display">\[ E[r_p] = \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i E[r_i]  \tag{4.1}\]</span></span> Unless otherwise stated, we will assume the portfolio is fully invested; that is, that <span class="math inline">\(\sum_i w_i = 1\)</span>. We will occasionally use the notation <span class="math inline">\(E(r_i)=\mu_i\)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="variance-and-standard-deviation" class="level3" data-number="4.1.2">
<h3 data-number="4.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="variance-and-standard-deviation"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Variance and Standard Deviation</h3>
<p>To measure the variability of the portfolio return, we will alternatively work with the portfolio variance or the portfolio standard deviation. The portfolio variance of an <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-asset portfolio is: <span id="eq-port-var-N"><span class="math display">\[ \text{var}[r_p] = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} w_i w_j \text{cov}[r_i,r_j]\,, \tag{4.2}\]</span></span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\text{cov}[r_i,r_j]\)</span> is the covariance between assets <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. Of course, the portfolio standard deviation is simply the square root of the portfolio variance. We will occasionally use the notation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_p\)</span> to represent portfolio variance, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{i,j}\)</span> for the covariance between the returns of assets <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_p\)</span> for the standard deviation of portfolio <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>’s return.</p>
Some insights into the portfolio variance can be obtained by considering each term in matrix view. The nine terms in the three asset case are:

<table border="1">
<!-- Row 1 -->

<td style="text-align:center; background-color:gray">
<span class="math inline">\(w_1 w_1 \text{cov}[r_1,r_1]\)</span>

</tbody></table>
The shaded cells along the diagonal contain covariances of an asset return with itself. These are variance terms, so the diagonal can be rewritten as:

<table border="1">

Further simplication is possible by looking at same-colored pairs of elements in the matrix below.<br>

<p>The two terms in each pair have the same value because <span class="math inline">\(\text{cov}[r_i,r_j]=\text{cov}[r_j,r_i]\)</span>. Thus, the portfolio variance can be rewritten as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{var}[r_p] = \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i^2 \text{var}[r_i]+ 2 \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j&gt;i} w_i w_j \text{cov}[r_i,r_j]\,.\]</span></p>

<h4 data-number="4.1.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="calculating-porfolio-variance"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2.1</span> Calculating Porfolio Variance</h4>
<p>Calculating each term and adding them up can quickly become tedious. Given a covariance matrix <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
    V =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \text{var}[r_1]     &amp; \text{cov}[r_1,r_2] &amp; \dots  &amp; \text{cov}[r_1,r_N] \\
        \text{cov}[r_2,r_1] &amp; \text{var}[r_2]     &amp; \dots  &amp; \text{cov}[r_2,r_N] \\
        \vdots              &amp; \vdots              &amp; \ddots &amp;  \vdots \\
        \text{cov}[r_N,r_1] &amp; \text{cov}[r_N,r_2] &amp; \dots  &amp; \text{var}[r_N] \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}\]</span> and a vector of weights</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[w'=[w_1\, w_2\,...\,w_N]\,,\]</span></p>
<p>we can calculate the portfolio variance as the matrix product</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{var}[r_p] = w'Vw \,.\]</span></p>
<p>In python, this can be accomplished using the w’ @ V @ w. In Excel, the command is =MMULT(TRANSPOSE(w),MMULT(V,w)).</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can use the bordered covariance method. ADD EXCEL SNIPPET HERE?</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="covariance-and-correlation" class="level3" data-number="4.1.3">
<h3 data-number="4.1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="covariance-and-correlation"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Covariance and Correlation</h3>
<p>When measuring comovement across assets, we will use either the covariance, an absolute measure of comovement, or correlation, which is scaled by the product of each asset’s standard deviations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{corr}[r_i,r_j] = \rho_{ij} = \frac{\text{cov}[r_i,r_j]}{\text{sd}[r_i]\cdot\text{sd}[r_j]}\,.\]</span></p>
<p>Correlations range between -1 (perfectly negatively correlated) and 1 (perfectly correlated). Covariances, on the other hand, can take any values.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="preferences"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Preferences</h2>
<p>In order to make statements about “optimal” portfolios, we need to describe the preferences of investors in some way. A standard way to do so is to use mean-variance utility. Simply put, we will assume that investors like higher expected returns and dislike portfolios with riskier returns. The amount of extra expected return needed for an investor to take on additional risk is governed by the investor’s risk aversion, which we will denote <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>Mathematically, mean-variance utility for a given portfolio return <span class="math inline">\(r_p\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ U(r_p)=E[r_p] - 0.5\cdot A \cdot \text{var}[r_p]\,.\]</span></p>
<p>The utility of a risky investment is simply its expected return minus a penalty for variance. More risk averse investors have higher values for <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, meaning that they put greater penalties on variance. <a href="#fig-indifference0">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.1</span></a> shows indifference curves for three different levels of risk aversion, but the same level of utility. A higher expected return is required to reach the utility for a given level of risk when risk aversion is higher, and the extra expected return increases when risk increases.</p>

<p>Investors are indifferent between portfolios that generate the same utility. <a href="#fig-indifference1">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.2</span></a> shows three different levels of utility, holding risk aversion fixed. A utility of, for example, 10% means that the investor would be indifferent between the risky investment and a risk-free investment with a return of 10%. That is, any portfolio located on the green indifference curve in <a href="#fig-indifference1">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.2</span></a> provides the same level of utility to this investor. Higher utility is achieved with either a higher expected return or lower risk or both.</p>

<p>The decision to invest any money in a risky asset is perhaps the most fundamental decision an investor makes. We will assume the existence of a risk-free asset. In the real world, this would be an asset like a Treasury bill or a money-market mutual fund. To fix ideas, we will consider a broad stock market index fund as the risky asset.</p>
<p>How much capital should be invested in each of these two assets? For a given portfolio weight in the risky asset <span class="math inline">\(w_{\text{risky}}\)</span>, we first need to determine the portfolio’s expected return and standard deviation. Considering all possible risky portfolio weights traces out the set of possible investments, which is called the capital allocation line in expected return/standard deviation space. Finally, we choose the risky portfolio weight that maximizes the investor’s utility.</p>
<p>From the two-asset case of <a href="#eq-port-var-N">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.2</span></a>, we see that the variance of portfolio <span class="math inline">\(r_p\)</span> with non-negative <span class="math inline">\(w_{\text{risky}}\)</span> invested in the risky asset and <span class="math inline">\(1-w_{\text{risky}}\)</span> invested in the risk-free rate is: <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    \text{var}[r_p] =&amp; w_{\text{risky}}^2 \text{var}[r_{\text{risky}}]+ (1-w_{\text{risky}})^2 \text{var}[r_f]+ 2 w_{\text{risky}}(1-w_{\text{risky}}) \text{cov}[r_{\text{risky}},r_f] \\
                    =&amp; w_{\text{risky}}^2 \text{var}[r_{\text{risky}}]+ (1-w_{\text{risky}})^2 \cdot 0 + 2 w_{\text{risky}}(1-w_{\text{risky}}) \cdot 0 \\
                     =&amp;w_{\text{risky}}^2 \text{var}[r_{\text{risky}}]\,,
\end{align}\]</span> where we have used the facts that the risk-free asset’s return is risk-free (<span class="math inline">\(\text{var}[r_f]=0\)</span>) and does not covary with the risky asset return. Thus, the portfolio’s standard deviation is:</p>
<p><span id="eq-sd-rf-risky"><span class="math display">\[ \text{sd}[r_p] = w_{\text{risky}}\cdot \text{sd}[r_{\text{risky}}]\,. \tag{4.3}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The expected return of the portfolio is: <span id="eq-expret-rf-risky"><span class="math display">\[ E[r_p] = w_{\text{risky}} E[r_{\text{risky}}]+ (1-w_{\text{risky}}) r_f \,. \tag{4.4}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Solving <a href="#eq-sd-rf-risky">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.3</span></a> for <span class="math inline">\(w_{\text{risky}}\)</span>, substituting into <a href="#eq-expret-rf-risky">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.4</span></a>, and rearranging yields the relationship between expected return and standard deviation along the capital allocation line:</p>
<p><span id="eq-cal"><span class="math display">\[ E[r_p] = r_f + \bigg[ \frac{E[r_{\text{risky}}]-r_f}{\text{sd}[r_{\text{risky}}] }\bigg] \cdot \text{sd}[r_p] \,. \tag{4.5}\]</span></span> The capital allocation line for a risky asset is a set of portfolios combining the risky asset with the risk-free asset. In expected return/volatility space, the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-intercept is the risk-free rate of return and the slope of the line is the ratio of the expected excess return of the risky asset to its standard deviation. This ratio is called the Sharpe ratio, after William Sharpe. We discuss it in more detail below in <a href="#sec-multiple-cals"><span>Section&nbsp;4.5</span></a>.</p>
<p>SHOULD WE GET INTO THIS HERE? IT COMPLICATES THE DISCUSSION OF WHERE TO LOCATE ON THE CAL BELOW? When <span class="math inline">\(w_{\text{risky}}&gt;100\%\)</span>, the portfolio is borrowing at the risk-free rate (that is, issuing bonds at the same rate as, say, US Treasuries). This is probably not a reasonable assumption. For most investors, <span class="math inline">\(r^{\text{borrow}}&gt;r^{\text{saving}}\)</span>. In this case, the capital allocation line is kinked at the risky-asset: <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\text{E}[r_p] = \begin{cases}
r_f^{\text{saving}} + \bigg[ \frac{E[r_{\text{risky}}]-r_f^{\text{saving}}}{\text{sd}[r_{\text{risky}}] }\bigg]\cdot \text{sd}[r_p] &amp; \text{if } \text{sd}[r_p] \le \text{sd}[r_{\text{risky}}] \\
  r_f^{\text{borrow}} + \bigg[ \frac{E[r_{\text{risky}}]-r_f^{\text{borrow}}}{\text{sd}[r_{\text{risky}}] }\bigg]\cdot \text{sd}[r_p] &amp; \text{if } \text{sd}[r_p] &gt; \text{sd}[r_{\text{risky}}] \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}\]</span> <a href="#fig-cal">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.3</span></a> shows the set of possible portfolios along the capital allocation line.</p>

<p>The choice of where to locate along the CAL is the choice of how much to invest in a risky portfolio <span class="math inline">\(w_{\text{risky}}\)</span>. A mean-variance investor chooses <span class="math inline">\(w_{\text{risky}}\)</span> to solve: <span id="eq-cal-optimization"><span class="math display">\[ \underset{w_{\text{risky}}}\max E[r_p] - 0.5\cdot A \cdot \text{var}[r_p]\,.  \tag{4.6}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Plugging in the expected return (<a href="#eq-expret-rf-risky">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.4</span></a>) and standard deviation ( <a href="#eq-sd-rf-risky">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.3</span></a>) into <a href="#eq-cal-optimization">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.6</span></a> and considering the first-order condition with respect to <span class="math inline">\(w_{\text{risky}}\)</span> provides the optimal weight to invest in the risky asset: <!-- $$ w^*_{\text{risky}} = \frac{E[r_{\text{risky}}-r_f]}{A \cdot \text{var}_{\text{risky}}}\,.$$ {#eq-cal-opt-wgt} --> <!-- ```{tex} --> <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
w^*_{\text{risky}} = \begin{cases}
    \frac{E[r_{\text{risky}}-r_f^{\text{saving}}]}{A \cdot \text{var}_{\text{risky}}} &amp; \text{if } A &gt; \frac{E[r_{\text{risky}}-r_f^{\text{saving}}]}{\text{var}_{\text{risky}}} \\
    100\% &amp; \text{if } \frac{E[r_{\text{risky}}-r_f^{\text{borrow}}]}{ \text{var}_{\text{risky}}} \le A \le \frac{E[r_{\text{risky}}-r_f^{\text{saving}}]}{\text{var}_{\text{risky}}} \\

<p>Thus, an investor’s location on the CAL depends on risk aversion. Investors with different risk aversion will choose different combinations of the risky asset and the risk-free asset. This is demonstrated in <a href="#fig-cal-preferences">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.4</span></a>.</p>

<p>Another way to see how risk aversion affects capital allocation is to plot the risky asset weight as a function of risk aversion, as in <a href="#fig-cal-wgt-by-riskaver">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.5</span></a>. Higher risk aversion translates into lower holdings of the risky asset. This effect is monotonic except for a region of risk aversion where the optimal weight is 100% in the market portfolio. This is due to the kink in the capital allocation line resulting from the difference in risk-free borrowing and savings rates.</p>

<p>Diversification is a foundational concept in forming portfolios. We will discuss the benefits of diversification repeatedly throughout this chapter. Consider forming a portfolio of two risky assets. To fix ideas, let’s consider these to be a broad stock market index fund and a long-term government bond fund. If we invest all of our capital in some combination of these two assets, what are the expected returns and standard deviations of all the potential portfolios? Assume for now that we cannot short sell either asset; that is, the fraction invested in each must be non-negative.</p>
<p>For some weight <span class="math inline">\(w_S\)</span> in the stock portfolio, the expected return of the portfolio is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ E[r_p] = w_S E[r_S] + (1-w_S) E[r_B]\,,\]</span></p>
<p>and the portfolio’s variance is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[  \text{var}[r_p] = w_S^2 \text{var}[r_S]+ (1-w_S)^2 \text{var}[r_B]+ 2 w_S (1-w_S) \rho_{S,B}\text{sd}[r_S]\text{sd}[r_B]\,. \]</span></p>
<p>Note that we have substituted out the covariance using the definition of correlation. We plot the possible combinations of the stock fund and bond fund in <a href="#fig-two-asset">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.6</span></a> for three distinct correlation values. The correlation of -5% is the realized correlation between stocks and bonds from 1980 to 2020. During that period though, the correlation varied dramatically, switching from negative to positive. From 1980 to 2000, the correlation was -63%, and it was 26% from 2000 to 2020. These differences can change the investment opportunity set substantially. With a correlation of -63%, the bond portfolio is dominated by a portfolio that invests just under 80% of wealth in bonds and the other 20% in stocks. This portfolio generates a higher expected return for the same level of risk.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-two-asset">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.6</span></a> shows the benefits of lower correlations across assets in the portfolio. For lower levels of correlation between stocks and bonds, it is possible to achieve a lower portfolio standard deviation for the same level of expected return. (Note: we are holding the stock and bond expected returns and standard deviations constant in the figure. In practice, these can also vary over time.)</p>

<p>We’ve now seen how to combine two risky assets as well as a risky asset with a risk-free asset. What if we can invest in two risky assets <em>and</em> the risk-free asset? What is the best way to form a portfolio in this case? We’ll proceed with our stock and bond fund example (assuming a -5% correlation).</p>
<p>First, let’s consider the investment opportunity sets that would obtain if we restricted attention to investing in only a single risky fund, along with the risk-free asset. The possible portfolios would be the capital allocation lines for the stock fund and the bond fund, respectively. These are plotted in as the orange and red lines in <a href="#fig-two-asset-plus_rf">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.7</span></a>. We can see immediately that all portfolios on the CAL for the stock fund are dominated by either the stock-bond frontier (the black line) or by the bond CAL. The same expected return can be achieved for smaller standard deviation.</p>
<p>Recall from <a href="#eq-cal">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.5</span></a> that the slope of the CAL for a risky asset is the Sharpe ratio. The Sharpe ratio is a measure of the excess return of an investment per unit of risk. Since investors like expected returns and dislike risk, they want high Sharpe ratios. Note in <a href="#fig-two-asset-plus_rf">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.7</span></a> that the Sharpe ratio of the bond is higher than that of the stock portfolio. In fact, the Sharpe ratio for all portfolios on the frontier have higher Sharpe ratios than that of the stock portfolio. The highest Sharpe ratio is obtained by combining the risk-free asset with a risky portfolio so that the CAL slope is as high as possible. This occurs when the CAL is tangent to the curve of risky-only portfolios.</p>
<p>When interest rates are lower than expected returns, the efficient portfolios fall into three regions, separated by blue dots in <a href="#fig-two-asset-plus_rf">Figure&nbsp;<span>4.7</span></a>. These blue dots indicate an efficient low risk portfolio and an efficient high mean portfolio, both comprised solely of risky assets. To the left of the efficient low risk portfolio, the optimal portfolios are scaled-down versions of the efficient low risk portfolio with some savings. To the right of the efficient high mean portfolio, the optimal portfolios are scaled-up versions of the efficient high mean portfolio with some borrowing. Both cases are shown as blue lines in the figure. The third region is the black curve between the efficient low risk and efficient high mean portfolios. These portfolios do not involve saving or borrowing. The blue dotted lines extend the blue solid lines, but the points on the blue dotted lines are infeasible, because they involve saving at the borrowing rate or borrowing at the savings rate. If the borrowing rate equals the savings rate, then the efficient low mean and efficient high risk portfolios are the same, which is called the tangency portfolio. If interest rates are set higher than expected returns, then the efficient portfolios may not exist or may be outside the plotted range.</p>
