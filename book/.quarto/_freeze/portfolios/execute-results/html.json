In this chapter, we will explore the risk and return of portfolios and how we can form optimal portfolios.  Our discussion will focus on the expected return and standard deviation of portfolio.  \n\n## Portfolio Statistics\n\nWe will calculate portfolio statistics as a function of the portfolio statistics of underlying assets (which themselves may be portfolios).  Assume that the distribution of each asset's return is known.  The return of asset $i$ has an expected value $E[r_i]$.  Assuming that the asset is risky, there is also some dispersion in potential realizations of the return above or below the mean.  The variance $\\text{var}[r_i]$ is the expected squared deviations of the possible deviations from the asset's expected value: $E\\big[(r_i-E[r_i])^2\\big]$.  The standard deviation $\\text{sd}[r_p]$ is simply the square root of the portfolio variance.  \n\n\nWhen measuring comovement across assets, we will use either the covariance, an absolute measure of comovement, or correlation, which is scaled by the product of each asset's standard deviations.  Recall that the covariance of two assets measures the expected value of the product of each asset's return deviation from its expected value:\n\n$$ \\text{cov}[r_i,r_j] = E\\big[(r_i-E[r_i])(r_j-E[r_j])\\big]\\\\,. $$ {#eq-cov-defn}\nIf return $i$ and $j$ both tend to have return realizations either above or below their expected values in the same underlying states of the world, then their covariance will be positive and the returns are said to comove.  Alternatively, if one asset tends to have realizations above its expected value in states of the world when the other asset has return realizations below its expected value, their covariance will be negative.  Comovement is also commonly measured using correlation:\n$$ \\text{corr}[r_i,r_j] = \\rho_{ij} = \\frac{\\text{cov}[r_i,r_j]}{\\text{sd}[r_i]\\cdot\\text{sd}[r_j]}\\,.$$ {#eq-corr-defn}\n\nCorrelations range between -1 (perfectly negatively correlated) and 1 (perfectly correlated).  Covariances, on the other hand, can take any values.\n\n### Two-Asset Portfolios\nThe return of a two-asset portfolio is the weighted sum of the returns of the underlying assets:\n\n$$ r_p = w_1 r_1 + w_2 r_2\\,, $$ {#eq-2asset-return}\nwhere $w_1$ and $w_2$ are the portfolio weights.  Unless otherwise stated, we will assume that portfolios are fully invested; that is, that the sum of the weights equal 1.  What is the expected return and riskiness of the portfolio of the two assets?  The expected return is simply the weighted average of each assets expected return:\n$$ E[r_p] = w_1 E[r_1] + w_2 E[r_2]\\,. $$ {#eq-2asset-expret}\n\nThe riskiness of the portfolio return can be measured by its variance, which measures the expected (squared) magnitude of deviations in the portfolio return from its expected value.  Specifically, the portfolio variance is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{var}[r_p] =& E\\big[(r_p-E[r_p])^2\\big] \\\\\n=& E\\big[( w_1 r_1 + w_2 r_2-w_1 E[r_1] - w_2 E[r_2])^2\\big] \\\\\n=& E\\big[( w_1 (r_1 - E[r_1])+ w_2 (r_2-E[r_2]))^2\\big] \\\\\n=& E\\big[(w_1^2(r_1 - E[r_1]))^2 + w_2^2(r_2-E[r_2])^2 + 2 w_1 w_2 (r_1 - E[r_1])(r_2-E[r_2])\\big] \\\\\n=& w_1^2 \\text{var}[r_1] + w_2^2\\text{var}[r_2]  + 2 w_1 w_2 \\text{cov}[r_1,r_2]\\,.\n\\end{align}\n$$ {#eq-2asset-variance}\n\n\n### Portfolios of N Assets\n\nThe return of a portfolio combining $N$ assets is simply the weighted average of the underlying asset returns:\n\n$$ r_p = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i r_i\\,, $$ {#eq-n-asset-return}\nwhere the weights $\\{w_i\\}_{i=1}^N$ are the fractions of capital invested in each asset.  The expected return of the portfolio is  the weighted sum of the expected returns of each asset:\n$$ E[r_p] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i E[r_i]\\,.$$ {#eq-n-asset-expret}\n\nThe riskiness of the portfolio, as measured by the portfolio variance, is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{var}[r_p] =& E\\bigg[(r_p-E[r_p])^2\\bigg] \\\\\n=& E\\bigg[\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i r_i - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i E[r_i]\\right)^2\\bigg] \\\\\n=& E\\bigg[\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i (r_i - E[r_i]) \\right)^2\\bigg] \\\\\n=& E\\bigg[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i^2 (r_i - E[r_i])^2 + 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j>i} w_i w_j (r_i - E[r_i])(r_j-E[r_j])\\bigg] \\\\\n=& \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i^2 \\text{var}[r_i] + 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j>i} w_i w_j \\text{cov}[r_i,r_j]\\,.\n\\end{align}\n$$ {#eq-n-asset-variance}\n\n\n\nCalculating each term in the last line of @eq-n-asset-variance and adding them up can quickly become tedious.  Given a covariance matrix $V$:\n\\begin{equation*}\n    V = \n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n        \\text{var}[r_1]     & \\text{cov}[r_1,r_2] & \\dots  & \\text{cov}[r_1,r_N] \\\\\n        \\text{cov}[r_2,r_1] & \\text{var}[r_2]     & \\dots  & \\text{cov}[r_2,r_N] \\\\\n        \\vdots              & \\vdots              & \\ddots &  \\vdots \\\\\n        \\text{cov}[r_N,r_1] & \\text{cov}[r_N,r_2] & \\dots  & \\text{var}[r_N] \\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}\nand a vector of portfolio weights \n\n$$w'=[w_1\\, w_2\\,...\\,w_N]\\,,$$\n\nwe can calculate the portfolio variance as the matrix product\n\n$$ \\text{var}[r_p] = w'Vw \\,.$$ {#eq-mmult-portvar}\n\n:::  {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Calculating Portfolio Statistics in Python^[In Excel, given an array of expected returns and portfolio weights, the portfolio expected return can be calculated using the SUMPRODUCT command.

AN ALTERNATIVE IS TO PUT ALL EXCEL INFORMATION IN AN APPENDIX TO EVERY CHAPTER\n:::\n\n\n## Diversification  {#sec-diversification}\n\nDiversification is a foundational concept in forming portfolios.  We will discuss the benefits of diversification repeatedly throughout this chapter. In the sections below, we will discuss diversification in the context of portfolios of two, three, or many risky assets.  We discuss a special portfolio which offers the lowest risk possible by combining a set of risky assets.  Finally, short-selling securities may allow for even greater diversification benefits.\n\n### Portfolios of Two Risky Assets {#sec-two-risky}\n\n Consider forming a portfolio of two risky assets.  To fix ideas, let's consider these to be a US stock market fund and an international stock market fund.  If we invest all of our capital in some combination of these two assets, what are the expected returns and standard deviations of all the potential portfolios? Assume for now that we cannot short sell either asset; that is, the fraction invested in each must be non-negative.\n\nFor some weight $w_{\\text{US}}$ in the US stock fund, the expected return of the portfolio is:\n\n$$ E[r_p] = w_{\\text{US}} E[r_{\\text{US}}] + (1-w_{\\text{US}}) E[r_{\\text{intl}}]\\,,$$\n\nand the portfolio's variance is:\n$$  \\text{var}[r_p] = w_{\\text{US}}^2 \\text{var}[r_{\\text{US}}]+ (1-w_{\\text{US}})^2 \\text{var}[r_{\\text{intl}}]+ 2 w_{\\text{US}} (1-w_{\\text{US}}) \\rho_{\\text{US},\\text{intl}}\\text{sd}[r_{\\text{US}}]\\text{sd}[r_{\\text{intl}}]\\,. $$ {#eq-2asset-variance-corr}\n\nNote that we have substituted out the covariance using the definition of correlation in @eq-corr-defn.  The correlation between US stocks and stocks from developed international economies was about 75% over the last thirty years.  @fig-two-asset plots the possible portfolios of the US and international stock funds.  The US stock market fund is dominated by a combination of the two funds.  There is a portfolio of the two funds that generates a higher expected return for the same level of risk!  This is diversification in action.\n\nDiversification benefits are greater when the assets are less correlated.  This can be seen from visual inspection of @eq-2asset-variance-corr.  The portfolio variance is lower for lower levels of the correlation between two assets.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport

Assets {#sec-three-risky}\n\nCould we do better?  Let's consider adding another risky asset into the mix.  In addition to US and developed international stocks, assume we also have access to an emerging market equity fund.  The emerging market fund has higher expected return, but also higher risk than the other two funds.  It also has a correlation of about 75% with each of the other two funds.  \n\n@fig-three-asset shows the investment opportunity set of investing in portfolios of these three funds.  Each of the blue dots represent a different possible combination of the three portfolios.  The lines connecting pairs of the assets show all possible portfolios of investing just in those two assets.  The diversification benefits of adding a third asset to any of the pairs of assets can be seen by the fact that many of the blue three-asset portfolios lie to the left of the two-asset frontiers.  That is, adding a third asset can produce a portfolio with the same expected return but lower portfolio risk than can be achieved with just two assets.  \n\nFor example, Consider an investor targeting a 6.5% return, the assumed expected return of the domestic international portfolio.  If the investor is restricted to hold only a single asset, they must hold the domestic international fund with risk of over 16% per year.  If an investor can hold two assets, they could lower the amount of risk by holding a portfolio of the US stock fund and the emerging market fund and reduce the portfolio risk to below 16% per year.  An additional diversification benefit is possible if the investor holds all three assets; an even lower standard deviation can be achieved for the same expected return.\n\n@fig-two-asset above showed that we could earn a higher expected return for the same level of risk as the US stock portfolio by investing in a mix of the US and developed international stocks.  @fig-three-asset shows that an even higher expected return is possible for that same level of risk if emerging market stocks are added to the portfolio.  A portfolio of approximately 50% US stocks, 35% developed international stocks, and 15% emerging market has about the same risk as being 100% in US stocks, but has a higher expected return.\n\n:::

Frontier {#sec-frontier}\n\nWith more than two risky assets, multiple portfolios can achieve the same expected return, but with different amounts of portfolio risk.  This was seen above in @fig-three-asset.  All else equal, investors like expected return and dislike risk, so for a given expected return level, lower levels of portfolio standard deviation are preferred.  For each level of expected return, we can find the portfolio that provides the highest possible diversification, that is, the lowest standard deviation.  The set of these minimum-variance portfolios is called the **frontier**.  The portfolio with the lowest standard deviation across all feasible expected returns is called the **global minimum variance (GMV)** portfolio.  Portfolios that lie on the frontier with expected returns above those of the GMV portfolio are said to be efficient, and this portion of the frontier is called the **efficient frontier**.\n\nMathematically, a frontier portfolio with expected return $\\mu_{\\text{target}}$ is defined by the portfolio weights that solve the following constrained optimization problem:\n\n$$ \\underset{w_1,w_2,\\dots,w_N}{\\text{min}} \\text{var}[r_p]$$ {#eq-frontier}\nsubject to constraints: $E[r_p]=\\mu_{\\text{target}}$ and $\\sum_i w_i=1$.  If short-selling is not allowed, we add an additional set of constraints: $w_i \\ge 0$ for all assets.  To trace out the frontier, we solve the problem for a range of target expected returns.\n\nThe GMV portfolio is the set of portfolio weights that minimizes portfolio variance without conditioning on the portfolio expected return:\n$$ \\underset{w_1,w_2,\\dots,w_N}{\\text{min}} \\text{var}[r_p]$$ {#eq-gmv}\n\nsubject to the constraints $\\sum_i w_i=1$.  Again, short-sales may or may not be allowed in solving this problem.\n\n@fig-frontier-gmv shows the frontier (without short sales) formed using the three equity funds.  The GMV portfolio is the portfolio with the lowest standard deviation on the left-hand side of the frontier.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport

The short-seller then has a liability to return the security to the security lender;  this liability is equal to the security's market value.  Short-sellers hope to purchase the security later for a lower price.  Thus, they reverse the order of the investing maxim: buy low-sell high.  Short-sellers hope to sell high-buy low.  In practice, there are limitations on short selling: it may not be possible to use the proceeds from a short sale to buy other risky assets, less than full interest may be earned on the proceeds, and a fee must be paid to borrow the asset being shorted. In this section, we ignore those issues. We assume that proceeds from short sales are invested in the other risky assets. \n\nIt may sometimes be possible to improve mean-variance efficiency by selling some assets short.  Short positions in a portfolio have negative portfolio weights ($w_i<0$).  @fig-frontier-gmv-shorting shows how the GMV portfolio and frontier changes if we allow short-selling of the three equity portfolios.  With short-selling allowed, a lower global minimum variance is possible.  This portfolio shorts emerging market equity and invests the proceeds and initial capital in a combination of US and developed international equities.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python

investor to reach expected returns values below the minimum expected returns of the assets (the US equity portfolio) and above the maximum expected return of the underlying assets (the emerging market portfolio).  These portfolios entail shorting the emerging market fund or the US equity fund, respectively.  \n\nWithin the set of expected returns possible without shorting, lower risk portfolios are possible with shorting for expected returns close to the US market fund's expected return and close to the emerging market fund's expected return.  Thus, short-selling may provide additional diversification benefits relative to those available to a short-sale-constrained investor.\n\n### N Risky Assets {#sec-n-risky}\n\nAdding more securities to a portfolio results in additional diversification benefits, but the marginal benefit of an additional security decreases with the total number of securities in the portfolio.  We discussed above that the diversification benefit in a two-asset case depends on the correlation between the two security returns.  For portfolios of many assets, the portfolio variance depends more on the average correlation across securities than it does on the riskiness of the securities themselves.  One reason for the sheer number of terms in the portfolio variance calculation @eq-n-asset-variance involving correlations (through the covariance terms).  We can write all of the terms in the three-asset version of @eq-n-asset-variance in matrix form as follows:\n\n<table style=\"border:1px solid black; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\">\n  <!-- Row 1 -->\n  <tr> \n    <td style=\"text-align:center; background-color:gray\">$w_1^2 \\text{var}[r_1]$</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align:center; background-color:lightblue\">$w_1 w_2 \\text{cov}[r_1,r_2]$</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align:center; background-color:lightcoral\">$w_1 w_3 \\text{cov}[r_1,r_3]$</td>\n  </tr>\n  <!-- Row 2 -->\n  <tr>\n    <td style=\"text-align:center; background-color:lightblue\">$w_2 w_1 \\text{cov}[r_2,r_1]$</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align:center; background-color:gray\">$w_2^2 \\text{var}[r_2]$</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align:center; background-color:#d9f2d9\">$w_2 w_3 \\text{cov}[r_2,r_3]$</td>\n  </tr>\n  <!-- Row 3 -->\n  <tr>\n    <td style=\"text-align:center; background-color:lightcoral\">$w_3 w_1 \\text{cov}[r_3,r_1]$</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align:center; background-color:#d9f2d9\">$w_3 w_2 \\text{cov}[r_3,r_2]$</td>\n    <td style=\"text-align:center; background-color:gray\">$w_3^2 \\text{var}[r_3]$</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nFor the three-asset portfolio, there are 3 variance terms and 3 distinct covariance terms.

For an $N$ asset portfolio, there will be $N$ variance terms and $\\frac{N^2-N}{2}$ distinct covariance terms.  For portfolios with many assets, the number of covariance terms will quickly dwarf the number of variance terms.\n\nTo see how correlation across assets can dominate the riskiness of individual securities in portfolios with many assets, consider an equally-weighted ($w_i=1/N$ for all assets) portfolio where all all assets have the same variance $(\\sigma^2_{\\text{all}})$ and all pairs of assets have the same covariance $(\\overline{\\text{cov}})$.  The variance of this equal-weighted portfolio is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n  \\text{var}(r_p) =& N\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)^2 \\sigma^2_{\\text{all}} + (N^2-N)\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)^2 \\overline{\\text{cov}} \\\\\n  =& \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right) \\sigma^2_{\\text{all}} + \\left(\\frac{N-1}{N}\\right) \\overline{\\text{cov}}\\,.\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAs $N$ gets very large, the portfolio variance approaches the common covariance across assets:\n\n$$ \\text{var}(r_p) \\underset{N\\rightarrow \\infty}{\\longrightarrow} 0\\cdot\\sigma^2_{\\text{all}}+(1-0)\\overline{\\text{cov}}=\\overline{\\text{cov}}\\,.$$ {#eq-diversification-limit}\n\n@fig-diversification plots the portfolio variance for this equally-weighted portfolio as a function of the number of assets for three correlation values.  The figure demonstrates three insights.  First, as discussed previously, the diversification benefit is greater for lower levels of correlation across assets (that is, lower $\\overline{\\text{cov}}$ here).  Second, the marginal benefit of adding additional securities to a portfolio decreases with the number of securities.  A large fraction of the overall risk reduction is due to the first 10 to 20 securities added to the portfolio.  Third, there is a limit to risk reduction, and this limit is governed by the amount of common comovement across assets in the portfolio.  $\\sigma_{\\text{all}}$ is assumed to be 40%, so @eq-diversification-limit tells us that the portfolio standard deviation approaches values of 12.6%, 20%, and 28.3%, respectively, for correlations of 10%, 25%, and 50% as the number of portfolio assets gets large.^[These limits are calculated using $\\text{sd}[r_p]=\\sqrt{\\overline{\\text{cov}}}=\\sqrt{\\overline{\\text{corr}}\\sigma^2_{\\text{all}}}$.] @fig-diversification shows that for portfolios of 200 assets, the portfolio standard deviation is already quite close to these limiting standard deviations.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as

Allocation to Risky Assets \n\nIn this section, we introduce risk-free assets for saving and borrowing into the investment opportunity set.  We generally consider assets like Treasury bills or money-market mutual funds as the risk-free asset for saving in practice.  Borrowing rates will depend on the investor's access to debt markets.\n\n### A Single Risky Asset {#sec-cal-1risky}\n\nWhat does the set of possible portfolios look like if we consider the US stock market index fund as the risky asset and Treasury bills as the risk-free asset.  For a given portfolio weight in the risky asset $w_{\\text{risky}}$, we first need to determine the portfolio's expected return and standard deviation.  Considering all possible risky portfolio weights traces out the set of possible investments, which is called the **capital allocation line** in expected return/standard deviation space.  \n\nFrom @eq-2asset-variance, the variance of portfolio $r_p$ with non-negative $w_{\\text{risky}}$ invested in the risky asset and $1-w_{\\text{risky}}$ invested in the risk-free rate is:\n\\begin{align}\n    \\text{var}[r_p] =& w_{\\text{risky}}^2 \\text{var}[r_{\\text{risky}}]+ (1-w_{\\text{risky}})^2 \\text{var}[r_f]+ 2 w_{\\text{risky}}(1-w_{\\text{risky}}) \\text{cov}[r_{\\text{risky}},r_f] \\\\ \n                    =& w_{\\text{risky}}^2 \\text{var}[r_{\\text{risky}}]+ (1-w_{\\text{risky}})^2 \\cdot 0 + 2 w_{\\text{risky}}(1-w_{\\text{risky}}) \\cdot 0 \\\\\n                     =&w_{\\text{risky}}^2 \\text{var}[r_{\\text{risky}}]\\,, \n\\end{align} \nwhere we have used the facts that the risk-free asset's return is risk-free ($\\text{var}[r_f]=0$) and does not covary with the risky asset return.  Thus, the portfolio's standard deviation is:\n$$ \\text{sd}[r_p] = w_{\\text{risky}}\\cdot \\text{sd}[r_{\\text{risky}}]\\,.$$ {#eq-sd-rf-risky}\n\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio is:\n\n$$ E[r_p] = w_{\\text{risky}} E[r_{\\text{risky}}]+ (1-w_{\\text{risky}}) r_f \\,.$$ {#eq-expret-rf-risky}\nSolving @eq-sd-rf-risky for $w_{\\text{risky}}$, substituting into @eq-expret-rf-risky, and rearranging yields the relationship between expected return and standard deviation along the capital allocation line:\n$$ E[r_p] = r_f + \\bigg[ \\frac{E[r_{\\text{risky}}]-r_f}{\\text{sd}[r_{\\text{risky}}] }\\bigg] \\cdot \\text{sd}[r_p] \\,.$$ {#eq-cal}\n\nThe capital allocation line for a risky asset is a set of portfolios combining the risky asset with the risk-free asset.  In expected return/standard deviation space, the $y$-intercept is the risk-free rate of return and the slope of the line is the ratio of the expected excess return of the risky asset to its standard deviation.  This ratio is called the Sharpe ratio, after Nobel laureate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Sharpe\"> William Sharpe </a>.  We discuss it in more detail below in @sec-multiple-cals.  \n\nWhen $w_{\\text{risky}}>100\\%$, the portfolio is borrowing at the risk-free rate (that is, issuing bonds at the same rate as, say, US Treasuries).  This is probably not a reasonable assumption.  For most investors, $r^{\\text{borrow}}>r^{\\text{saving}}$.  In this case, the capital allocation line is kinked at the risky-asset:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{E}[r_p] = \\begin{cases}\n r_f^{\\text{saving}} + \\bigg[ \\frac{E[r_{\\text{risky}}]-r_f^{\\text{saving}}}{\\text{sd}[r_{\\text{risky}}] }\\bigg]\\cdot \\text{sd}[r_p] & \\text{if } \\text{sd}[r_p] \\le \\text{sd}[r_{\\text{risky}}] \\\\\n  r_f^{\\text{borrow}} + \\bigg[ \\frac{E[r_{\\text{risky}}]-r_f^{\\text{borrow}}}{\\text{sd}[r_{\\text{risky}}] }\\bigg]\\cdot \\text{sd}[r_p] & \\text{if } \\text{sd}[r_p] > \\text{sd}[r_{\\text{risky}}] \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\n@fig-cal shows the set of possible portfolios along the capital allocation line.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python

asset (@sec-cal-1risky).  What if we can invest in two risky assets *and* the risk-free asset?  What is the best way to form a portfolio in this case?  Let's assume that in addition to the US stock market fund, we are also considering investing in a long-term bond fund.   Empirically, over the last 30 or 40 years, equities and long-term government bonds have been almost uncorrelated; we will use a correlation of -5% below.\n\nFirst, consider the investment opportunity sets that would obtain if we restricted attention to investing in only a single risky fund (either the stock or bond fund) in conjunction with the risk-free asset.  We assume for the moment that we can both borrow and save at a single risk-free rate.  The possible portfolios are the capital allocation lines for the stock fund and the bond fund, respectively.  These are plotted as the orange and red lines in @fig-two-asset-plus_rf.  We can see immediately that all portfolios on the CAL for the stock fund are dominated by both the stock-bond frontier (the black line) and by the bond CAL.  The same expected return can be achieved for smaller standard deviation.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport

@eq-cal that the slope of the CAL for a risky asset is the Sharpe ratio.  The **Sharpe ratio** is a measure of the excess return of an investment per unit of risk.  Since investors like expected returns and dislike risk, they want high Sharpe ratios.  Note in @fig-two-asset-plus_rf that the Sharpe ratio of the bond is higher than that of the stock portfolio.  In fact, the Sharpe ratio for all portfolios on the frontier have higher Sharpe ratios than that of the stock portfolio.  The highest Sharpe ratio is obtained by combining the risk-free asset with a risky portfolio so that the CAL slope is as high as possible. This occurs when the CAL is tangent to the curve of risky-only portfolios.  This portfolio of risky assets is thus called the **tangency portfolio**.  Investing along the CAL of the tangency portfolio offers the highest possible Sharpe ratio, regardless of any desired level of expected return or risk.\n\n\nNow relax the restriction that the risk-free rate applies to borrowing as well as saving--$r_f^{\\text{borrow}}>r_f^{\\text{saving}}$.  In this case, efficient portfolios fall into three regions, separated by blue dots in  @fig-two-asset-plus_rf_saveborrow.^[This is true if the interest rates are lower than expected returns. If interest rates are set higher than expected returns, then the efficient portfolios may not exist.]  These blue dots indicate an efficient low risk portfolio and an efficient high mean portfolio, both comprised solely of risky assets. To the left of the efficient low risk portfolio, the efficient portfolios are scaled-down versions of the efficient low risk portfolio with some savings. To the right of the efficient high mean portfolio, the efficient portfolios are scaled-up versions of the efficient high mean portfolio with some borrowing. Both cases are shown as blue lines in the figure. The third region is the portion of the efficient frontier between the efficient low risk and efficient high mean portfolios. These portfolios do not involve saving or borrowing. The blue dotted lines extend the blue solid lines, but the points on the blue dotted lines are infeasible, because they involve saving at the borrowing rate or borrowing at the savings rate. \n\n:::

borrowing\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Preferences and Optimal Portfolios {#sec-preferences}\n\nIn this section, we consider perhaps the most fundamental allocation decision an investor makes: how much capital should be allocated to risky assets relative to a risk-free asset.  We will thus assume the existence of a risk-free asset for both saving and borrowing.  In the world, we generally consider assets like a Treasury bill or a money-market mutual fund as the risk-free asset for saving.\n\n\nIn order to make statements about \"optimal\" portfolios, we need to describe the preferences of investors in some way.  A standard way to do so is to use mean-variance utility.  Simply put, we will assume that investors like higher expected returns and dislike portfolios with riskier returns.  The amount of extra expected return needed for an investor to take on additional risk is governed by the investor's risk aversion, which we will denote $A$.\n\nMathematically, mean-variance utility for a given portfolio return $r_p$ is:\n\n$$ U(r_p)=E[r_p] - 0.5\\cdot A \\cdot \\text{var}[r_p]\\,.$$\n\nThe utility of a risky investment is simply its expected return minus a penalty for variance.  More risk averse investors have higher values for $A$, meaning that they put greater penalties on variance.  @fig-indifference0 shows indifference curves for three different levels of risk aversion, but the same level of utility.  A higher expected return is required to reach the utility for a given level of risk when risk aversion is higher, and the extra expected return increases when risk increases.\n\n::: {.cell

different levels of utility, holding risk aversion fixed.  A utility of, for example, 10% means that the investor would be indifferent between the risky investment and a risk-free investment with a return of 10%.  That is, any portfolio located on the green indifference curve in @fig-indifference1 provides the same level of utility to this investor.  Higher utility is achieved with either a higher expected return or lower risk or both.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom

aversion, as in @fig-cal-wgt-by-riskaver.  Higher risk aversion translates into lower holdings of the risky asset.  This effect is monotonic except for a region of risk aversion where the optimal weight is 100% in the market portfolio.  This is due to the kink in the capital allocation line resulting from the difference in risk-free borrowing and savings rates.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy

The Portfolio Class in Python {#sec-portfolio-class}\n\nA number of the examples in this chapter make use of the Portfolio class object defined below.  The Portfolio class object implements the various quadratic programming problems encountered in mean-variance analysis using the CVXOPT package.  The CVXOPT user guide is available <a href=\"https://cvxopt.org/userguide/index.html\"> here </a>.\n\nThe function `cvxopt.solvers.qp` solves problems of the general form:\n\\begin{align}\n    \\underset{w}{\\text{min  }}& \\frac{1}{2} w' Q w + p'x \\\\\n     \\text{subject to  } & Gw \\le h \\\\\n                        & Aw = b \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\nFor our purposes, the optimizer is usually solving for a $N \\times 1$ vector of portfolio weights, $w$.  The objective function often takes $Q$ as the $N \\times N$ covariance matrix of returns and $p$ as a $N \\times 1$ vector of zeros.  \n\nThe constraint $Gw \\le h$ can be used to put position limits on the portfolio weights.  The most common use of this is short-selling constraints.  This is accomplished by setting $G$ equal to the negative of the $N \\times N$ identity matrix (that is, a matrix with -1s on the diagonal and zero elsewhere), and $h$ equal to a $N \\times 1$ vector of zeros.  Additional position limits could be enforced by adding rows to $G$ and $h$.  For instance, many funds have maximum position limits in addition to short-sale constraints.\n\nThe constraint $Aw=b$ usually includes the constraint that the portfolio is fulling invested; that is, the portfolio weights sum to 100%.  This is accomplished by setting $A$ equal to a $N \\times 1$ vector of ones and setting $b=1$.  $A$ and $b$ can include additional rows for other constraints.  For instance, setting a target expected return would be accomplished by adding a row to $A$ with the asset mean vector and adding a row to $b$ with the target expected return.  This is done when solving for a point on the mean-variance frontier.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## Defining the Portfolio Class in Python\n``` p\nimport numpy as np\nfrom cvxopt import matrix\nfrom cvxopt.solvers import qp as Solver, options as SolverOptions\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar\n\nSolverOptions[\"show_progress\"] = False\n\nclass portfolio:\n    def __init__(self, means, cov, Shorts):\n        self.means = np.array(means)\n        self.cov = np.array(cov)\n        self.Shorts = Shorts\n        self.n = len(means)\n        if Shorts:\n            w = np.linalg.solve(cov, np.ones(self.n))\n            self.GMV = w / np.sum(w)\n            w = np.linalg.solve(cov, means)\n            self.piMu = w / np.sum(w)\n        else:\n            n = self.n\n            Q = matrix(cov, tc=\"d\")\n            p = matrix(np.zeros(n), (n, 1), tc=\"d\")\n            G = matrix(-np.identity(n), tc=\"d\")\n            h = matrix(np.zeros(n), (n, 1), tc=\"d\")\n            A = matrix(np.ones(n), (1, n), tc=\"d\")\n            b = matrix([1], (1, 1), tc=\"d\")\n            sol = Solver(Q, p, G, h, A, b)\n            self.GMV = np.array(sol[\"x\"]).flatten() if sol[\"status\"] == \"optimal\" else np.array(n * [np.nan])\n\n    def frontier(self, m):\n        if self.Shorts:\n            gmv = self.GMV\n            piMu = self.piMu\n            m1 = gmv @ self.means\n            m2 = piMu @ self.means\n            a = (m - m2) / (m1 - m2)\n            return a * gmv + (1 - a) * piMu\n        else:\n            n = self.n\n            Q = matrix(self.cov, tc=\"d\")\n            p = matrix(np.zeros(n), (n, 1), tc=\"d\")\n            G = matrix(-np.identity(n), tc=\"d\")\n            h = matrix(np.zeros(n), (n, 1), tc=\"d\")\n            A = matrix(np.vstack((np.ones(n), self.means)), (2, n), tc=\"d\")\n            b = matrix([1, m], (2, 1), tc=\"d\")\n            sol = Solver(Q, p, G, h, A, b)\n            return np.array(sol[\"x\"]).flatten() if sol[\"status\"] == \"optimal\" else np.array(n * [np.nan])\n\n    def tangency(self, r):\n        if self.Shorts:\n            w = np.linalg.solve(self.cov, self.means - r)\n            return w / np.sum(w)\n        else:\n            def f(m):\n                w = self.frontier(m)\n                mn = w @ self.means\n                sd = np.sqrt(w.T @ self.cov @ w)\n                return - (mn - r) / sd\n            m = minimize_scalar(f, bounds=[max(r, np.min(self.means)), max(r, np.max(self.means))], method=\"bounded\").x\n            return self.frontier(m)\n\n    def optimal(self, raver, rs=None, rb=None):\n        n = self.n\n        if self.Shorts:\n            if (rs or rs==0) and (rb or rb==0):\n                Q = np.zeros((n + 2, n + 2))\n                Q[2:, 2:] = raver * self.cov\n                Q = matrix(Q, tc=\"d\")\n                p = np.array([-rs, rb] + list(-self.means))\n                p = matrix(p, (n + 2, 1), tc=\"d\")\n                G = np.zeros((2, n + 2))\n                G[0, 0] = G[1, 1] = -1\n                G = matrix(G, (2, n+2), tc=\"d\")\n                h = matrix([0, 0], (2, 1), tc=\"d\")\n                A = matrix([1, -1] + n*[1], (1, n+2), tc=\"d\")\n                b = matrix([1], (1, 1), tc=\"d\")\n                sol = Solver(Q, p, G, h, A, b)\n                return np.array(sol[\"x\"]).flatten()[2:] if sol[\"status\"] == \"optimal\" else None\n            else:\n                w = np.linalg.solve(self.cov, self.means)\n                a = np.sum(w)\n                return (a/raver)*self.piMu + (1-a/raver)*self.GMV\n        else:\n           if (rs or rs==0) and (rb or rb==0):\n                Q = np.zeros((n + 2, n + 2))\n                Q[2:, 2:] = raver * self.cov\n                Q = matrix(Q, tc=\"d\")\n                p = np.array([-rs, rb] + list(-self.means))\n                p = matrix(p, (n+2, 1), tc=\"d\")\n                G = matrix(-np.identity(n + 2), tc=\"d\")\n                h = matrix(np.zeros(n+2), (n+2, 1), tc=\"d\")\n                A = matrix([1, -1] + n * [1], (1, n+2), tc=\"d\")\n                b = matrix([1], (1, 1), tc=\"d\")\n                sol = Solver(Q, p, G, h, A, b)\n                return np.array(sol[\"x\"]).flatten()[2:] if sol[\"status\"] == \"optimal\" else None\n           else:\n                Q = matrix(raver * self.cov, tc=\"d\")\n                p = matrix(-self.means, (n, 1), tc=\"d\")\n                G = matrix(-np.identity(n), tc=\"d\")\n                h = matrix(np.zeros(n), (n, 1), tc=\"d\")\n                A = matrix(np.ones(n), (1, n), tc=\"d\")\n                b = matrix([1], (1, 1), tc=\"d\")\n                sol = Solver(Q, p, G, h, A, b)\n                return np.array(sol[\"x\"]).flatten() if sol[\"status\"] == \"optimal\" else None\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Appendix: Portfolios in Excel {#sec-excel}\n\nMAYBE WE COLLECT ALL OF THE EXCEL TUTORIALS HERE AND DO PYTHON ONLY IN THE MAIN TEXT?\n\n",
