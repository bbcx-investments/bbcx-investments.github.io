    "text": "If an investment account earns a steady rate of return and funds are not withdrawn from the account, then the account balance will grow exponentially. This is sometimes called the “miracle of compound interest.” Figure 1.1 shows the growth of an investment account earning 8% per year, which is what the U.S. stock market earned in real terms over the thirty year period 1992-2021. Each dollar grows to roughly $10 over a 30 year period at an 8% annual return. The exponential nature of the growth can be seen from the figure. Hover over the plot to see the exact values.\nInvestments grow exponentially because they earn returns each year not just on the starting balance but also on all prior returns. Exponential growth is much better than linear growth. By “linear growth,” we mean that doubling the investment period would double the account growth. Exponential is much better than that. As can be seen from the figure, $1 would grow to slightly more than $3 in 15 years at 8% per year, so the growth in value is slightly more than $2. Doubling the investment horizon to 30 years increases the growth to $9 (from $1 to $10), so the growth in value is more than four times larger when the horizon doubles, with an 8% return. Because of exponential growth, it is incredibly important to invest early and to refrain from borrowing whenever possible (unless the borrowing finances the purchase of long-term assets).\nExponential growth also means that the rate of return one earns is extremely important. For example, one might think that earning 8% is twice as good as earning 4%, but that is an understatement. Over a 30 year period, earning 8% is more than four times as good as earning 4%—a dollar grows by $9 to $10 over 30 years at 8%, but it grows by less than $2.25 at 4%.\nThe values in Figure 1.1 are calculated from the following logic. $1 invested for 1 year at 8% grows to $1.08. After another year at 8%, we have \\[\\begin{align*}\n1.08 + (1.08 \\times 0.08) &= (1.08 \\times 1) + (1.08 \\times 0.08)\\\\ &  = 1.08 \\times 1.08 \\\\ &= 1.08^2\n\\end{align*}\\] Continuing with this logic, we can see that after \\(n\\) years, we have \\(1.08^n\\). Thus, the number of years is the exponent of the factor 1.08, which is the definition of exponential growth.\nAs remarked above, the exponential growth is due to earning returns on top of returns or “interest on interest.” After two years at 8%, we have \\[1.08^2 = 1 + 0.08 + 0.08 + (0.08\\times 0.08).\\] Linear growth would be just adding up the returns \\(0.08 + 0.08\\). Exponential growth is due to the “interest on interest” term \\(0.08 \\times 0.08.\\) This is a small number when there are only two years, but these terms add up to a very large number over many years. They are responsible for the growth in the investment account quadrupling (from $2.17 to $9.06) when the investment horizon is doubled (from 15 to 30 years) with 8% returns."

    "text": "1.1 Future values and present values\nWe call \\(1.08^n\\) the future value of $1 for an \\(n\\)-year horizon and 8% returns. We can write this more generally as \\((1+r)^n\\), where \\(r\\) is the rate of return (0.08 in our example). The future value \\((1+r)^n\\) is what \\$1 grows to in \\(n\\) years when the rate of return is \\(r\\).\nWe also call $1 the present value of \\((1+r)^n\\). It is how much you need to invest to reach \\((1+r)^n\\) in \\(n\\) years when the rate of return is \\(r\\). More generally, we call \\(x\\) the present value of \\(y\\), and we call \\(y\\) the future value of \\(x\\) when \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are related as \\[y=x(1+r)^n,\\] because \\(x\\) will grow to \\(y\\) in \\(n\\) years when the rate of return is \\(r\\). To see this, consider a concrete example, say \\(x=10\\). We can think of an investment account starting with \\(x=10\\) as the sum of 10 hypothetical separate accounts, each starting with $1. We just saw that $1 will grow to \\((1+r)^n\\) dollars in \\(n\\) years when the rate of return is \\(r\\). At the end of the \\(n\\) years, we can hypothetically consolidate the separate accounts, having a total of 10 times \\((1+r)^n\\); in other words, \\(x(1+r)^n\\).\nWe compute the future value \\(y\\) from the present value \\(x\\) by mutliplying \\(x\\) by \\((1+r)^n\\), so we call \\((1+r)^n\\) the future value factor. Because the relation \\(y=x(1+r)^n\\) is equivalent to \\[x = \\frac{y}{(1+r)^n},\\] we can also compute the present value \\(x\\) from the future value \\(y\\) by dividing by \\((1+r)^n\\) or, equivalently, by multiplying by \\(1/(1+r)^n\\). Consequently, we call \\(1/(1+r)^n\\) the present value factor (or discount factor). The operation of multiplying by the present value factor is called discounting, and the operation of multiplying by the future value factor is called compounding. We also call the rate of return \\(r\\) the discount rate.\nThe values in Figure 1.1 are future value factors at 4% and 8%, for various \\(n\\). Figure 1.2 presents the analogous present value factors. Present value factors are smaller the further out in the future we look, and they are smaller when the discount rate is larger.\n\n\nCode\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport numpy as np\n\ntrace1= go.Scatter(\n    x=np.arange(31), \n    y=1.08**(-np.arange(31)),\n    mode=\"lines\",\n    name=\"8%\"\n)\ntrace2 = go.Scatter(\n    x=np.arange(31), \n    y=1.04**(-np.arange(31)),\n    mode=\"lines\",\n    name=\"4%\"\n)\nfig = go.Figure()\nfig.add_trace(trace1)\nfig.add_trace(trace2)\nstring = \"year %{x}<br>PV factor = %{y:.1%}\"\nfig.update_traces(hovertemplate=string)\nfig.update_layout(\n    template=\"none\",\n    xaxis_title=\"Year\",\n    yaxis_title=\"PV Factor\",\n    yaxis_tickformat=\".0%\",\n    legend=dict(\n        yanchor=\"top\", \n        y=0.99, \n        xanchor=\"right\", \n        x=0.99\n        )\n)\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 1.2: Present Value Factors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture and present value factors\n\n\n\nThe numpy arange function is useful for creating sequences (arrays) of future value and present value factors.\nimport numpy as np\nn = 30\nr = 0.08\nfvFactors = (1+r)**np.arange(1, n+1)\npvFactors = (1+r)**np.arange(-1, -n-1, -1)"

How much will we have in \\(n\\) years if we earn a return \\(r\\) each year? In other words, what is the total future value of the sequence of investments \\(x_0, \\ldots, x_m\\)?\nWe can answer this question by treating our investment account as \\(m+1\\) hypothetical separate accounts. In the first account, we deposit \\(x_0\\) today and it grows for \\(n\\) years to \\(x_0(1+r)^n\\). In the second account, we deposit \\(x_1\\) in one year and it grows for \\(n-1\\) years to \\(x_1(1+r)^{n-1}\\).

If we want to finance all of these expenditures from a current investment account, how much do we need to have in the account now, assuming we always earn a return \\(r\\) on the remaining balance? The answer is that we need to have the total present value of the future values \\(y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_m\\); that is, we need \\[\\frac{y_1}{1+r} + \\frac{y_2}{(1+r)^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{y_m}{(1+r)^m}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating present values as a sum of array products\n\n\n\nThe total present value can also be computed by summing the product of two arrays as in the following example.\nimport numpy as np\nm = 4\nr = 0.08\ny1, y2, y3, y4 = 100, 120, 130, 140, 150\ny = np.array([y1, y2, y3, y4])\npvFactors = (1+r)**np.arange(-1, -m-1, -1)\ntotal = np.sum(y*pvFactors)\n\n\nOur examples here involved only positive cash flows, but it is also possible to compute total future values or total present values in this way when some cash flows are positive and some are negative. In this case, the total present value is usually called the net present value, being the present value of the positive cash flows net of the present value of the negative cash flows."

    "text": "1.3 Perpetuities and annuities\nAn annuity is a level sequence of cash flows that extend for a finite period of time. A perpetuity is a level sequence of cash flows that extend forever. Annuities are encountered frequently, for example, in mortgage or other loan payments. Perpetuities are encountered less often; however, studying them is still useful, in part because it leads to a simple valuation formula for annuities.\nSuppose we want to spend \\(y\\) in one year, another \\(y\\) in two years, and so on forever. How much do we need to have in an investment account today to finance all of these expenditures, if the account always earns \\(r\\) per year? The answer is the sum of the present values, which is \\[\\frac{y}{1+r} + \\frac{y}{(1+r)^2} + \\frac{y}{(1+r)^3} + \\cdots\\] The series of terms \\(y/(1+r)^n\\) is a geometric series, and the present value is the sum of a geometric series, which by a standard formula equals \\[\\frac{y/(1+r)}{1- 1/(1+r)} = \\frac{y}{r}.\\] Thus, \\(y/r\\) is the present value of a perpetuity of \\(y\\) per year, given a rate of return of \\(r\\) per year. We can also reach this conclusion without using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. If we start with \\(y/r\\) in the account, then we will earn \\(r \\times y/r=y\\) in the first year, which we can spend without depleting our capital of \\(y/r\\). Clearly, we can continue this forever, so \\(y/r\\) is exactly the amount we need to finance an expenditure of \\(y\\) per year.\nNow consider an annuity of \\(y\\) per year for \\(n\\) years. The present value is \\[\\frac{y}{1+r} + \\frac{y}{(1+r)^2}  + \\cdots + \\frac{y}{(1+r)^n}\\] This can be calculated in terms of what we call the annuity factor: \\[ \\text{AF} = \\frac{1}{r} \\left(1-\\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}\\right).\\] The present value of the annuity is \\[ y \\times \\text{AF}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeriving the annuity formula\n\n\n\nTo derive the formula for the present value of an annuity, observe that an annuity is the difference of two perpetuities: a perpetuity that starts in a year and another perpetuity that starts in \\(n+1\\) years. So, the present value is the difference of two present values: the present value \\(y/r\\) of the first perpetuity minus the present value of the second perpetuity. The present value of the second perpetuity as of year \\(n\\) (one year before it begins) is \\(y/r\\) and that value discounted to today is \\[\\frac{1}{(1+r)^n} \\times \\frac{y}{r}.\\] Hence, the present value of the annuity is \\[\\frac{y}{r} - \\frac{1}{(1+r)^n} \\times \\frac{y}{r} = \\frac{y}{r} \\left(1-\\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}\\right) = y \\times \\text{AF}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating annuity values\n\n\n\nHere are three ways to compute the present value of an annuity in python. You may need to install the numpy_financial library (“pip install numpy-financial”) for the third.\nimport numpy as np\nn = 10\ny = 100\nr = 0.08\n\n# method 1\npvFactors = (1+r)**np.arange(-1, -n-1, -1)\npv = y * np.sum(pvFactors)\n\n# method 2\nAF = (1/r) * (1 - (1+r)**(-n))\npv = y * AF\n\n# method 3\nimport numpy_financial as npf\npv = npf.pv(rate=r, nper=n, pmt=-y)\n\n\nWe sometimes encounter finite or infinite sequences of cash flows that grow at a constant rate. Consider a cash flow of \\(y\\) in one year, \\((1+g)y\\) in two years, \\((1+g)^2y\\) in three years, etc., for some growth rate \\(g\\). If the growing cash flows go on forever, then the present value is \\[\\frac{y}{1+r} + \\frac{(1+g)y}{(1+r)^2} + \\frac{(1+g)^2y}{(1+r)^3} + \\cdots\\] If \\(g \\ge r\\), meaning that growth in the cash flows is so fast that it offsets or more than offsets the discounting, then the terms in this series are constant or rising, so the sum is infinite. If \\(g<r\\), then the formula for the sum of a geometric series shows that the present value is \\[\\frac{y/(1+r)}{1-(1+g)/(1+r)} =  \\frac{y}{r-g}.\\] We can also see this by assuming that we start with \\(y/(r-g)\\). In the first year, we earn \\(ry/(r-g)\\) from which we can spend \\(y\\) and reinvest \\(ry/(r-g)-y =gy/(r-g)\\), so our account will grow at rate \\(g\\). This growth is enough to finance a cash flow growing at rate \\(g\\), and this can continue forever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValuing growing annuities\n\n\n\nIf a sequence of growing cash flows lasts for a finite number \\(n\\) of years, then it is a growing annuity, and its value is the difference of the values of two growing perpetuities. Similar to the case of a level annuity, we can compute the value of a growing annuity as \\[\\frac{y}{r-g} - \\frac{1}{(1+r)^n} \\times \\frac{y}{r-g} = \\frac{y}{r-g}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}\\right).\\]"

    "section": "1.4 Monthly rates, etc.",
    "text": "1.4 Monthly rates, etc.\nWe frequently encounter rates of return, including interest rates, at frequencies other than a year, for example, when calculating monthly mortgage payments. There are two ways of relating monthly rates to annual rates. One is to compound monthly rates; the other is to multiply by 12.\nFirst we address compounding. Just as we calculated a future value by compounding an annual rate, we can also calculate a future value by compounding a monthly rate. The future value of $1 in one year, with a monthly rate of \\(r_m\\), is \\((1+r_m)^{12}\\). The growth in value is \\[(1+r_m)^{12} - 1.\\] This is the annual rate of return obtained by monthly compounding at the monthly rate \\(r_m\\). For example, if the monthly rate is 1%, then the annual rate is \\[ r_a = (1+r_m)^{12} - 1 = 1.01^{12} - 1 = 0.1268.\\] So, a monthly rate of 1% compounds to 12.68% annually.\nWe can reverse this calculation and compute the monthly rate given the annual rate. The formula for the monthly rate is \\[r_m = (1+r_a)^{1/12} - 1.\\] If we plug in \\(r_a = 0.1268\\), we’ll get \\(r_m = 0.01\\) (up to rounding error).\nThis is a logical way to define monthly rates from annual rates, but it is not the way a bank does it when you take out a loan. If a bank says that the annual rate is 12.68%, then it will charge you \\[\\frac{0.1268}{12} = 0.0106.\\] So, the bank will charge you 1.06% monthly. Obviously, this works in the bank’s favor, relative to the calculation based on compounding.\nReturning to the compounding calculation, we could also compound at frequencies other than a month or a year. If we compound daily at a daily rate of \\(r_d\\), then the corresponding annual rate is \\[r_a = (1+r_d)^{365} - 1.\\] The annual rate achieved by compounding is higher the more frequently a bank compounds. Continuing with our previous example of 12.68%, with monthly compounding we have \\[\\left(1 + \\frac{0.1268}{12}\\right)^{12} - 1 = 0.1344\\] and with daily compounding we have \\[\\left(1 + \\frac{0.1268}{365}\\right)^{365} - 1 = 0.1351.\\] Thus, increasing the compounding frequency increases the corresponding annual rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuously compounded returns\n\n\n\nWe could consider even more frequent compounding. In the limit, as compounding becomes continuous, we can invoke a result from mathematical analysis to obtain \\[\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}  \\left(1 + \\frac{0.1268}{n}\\right)^{n} - 1  = e^{0.1268} - 1 = 0.1352,\\] where \\(e\\) is the natural exponential (\\(2.718\\ldots\\)). More generally, continuous compounding at rate \\(z\\) means that $1 grows to \\(e^z\\) dollars in a year. For any return \\(r\\), there is an equivalent continuously compounded return given by \\(\\log (1+r)\\) where \\(\\log\\) denotes the natural logarithm function. To see this, let \\(z=\\log (1+r)\\). With continuous compounding at rate \\(z\\), $1 grows to \\(e^z = e^{\\log (1+r)} = 1+r\\). Thus, continuous compounding at rate \\(\\log (1+r)\\) is the same as earning \\(r\\). Obviously, continuous compounding is never encountered in practice, but it is a useful “as if” device for some calculations.\n."

    "text": "1.5 Principal, payments, and rate\nWhen buying a car or home, we might have one or more of the following questions.\n\nI know how much I want to borrow, what the term of the loan will be, and what the rate will be. What will my payments be?\nI know what the term of the loan will be and what the rate will be, and I know the payment that I can afford. How much can I borrow?\nI know what the term of the loan will be, how much I want to borrow, and how much I can afford to pay. What rate do I need to get?\n\nIn this section, we explain how to answer these questions. For concreteness, suppose the loan will have monthly payments. We will work in terms of an annual rate \\(r\\) and calculate the monthly rate as \\(r/12\\) the way banks do. Analogous calculations can be used to answer the questions for loans with annual payments.\nOur guiding principle is the formula for the present value of an annuity: \\[\\text{PV} = y \\times \\text{AF}\\] where the annuity factor, with a monthly rate of \\(r/12\\) and a term of \\(n\\) years (so, \\(12n\\) months), is \\[\\text{AF} = \\frac{1}{r/12}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{(1+r/12)^{12n}}\\right).\\] This formula applies to the given questions with PV equal to the loan amount and \\(y\\) equal to the loan payment. In other words, the relation between the loan amount and the loan payments is that the present value of the payments equals the loan amount (loan principal).\nThe answers to the questions are as follows. It is a bit more complicated to calculate the required rate than it is to calculate the payment and loan amount.\n\nThe loan payment is the loan amount divided by the annuity factor.\nThe loan amount is the loan payment multiplied by the annuity factor.\nThe required rate is the rate that makes the annuity factor equal to the ratio of the loan amount to the loan payment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating principals and payments\n\n\n\nHere are ways to calculate a loan payment or loan amount.\nimport numpy as np\nn = 30     # number of years\nr = 0.04   # annual rate\n\nAF = (12/r) * (1 - (1+r/12)**(-12*n))\n\n# calculate the loan payment\nprincipal = 100000\npayment = principal / AF\n\n# calculate the loan amount\npayment = 2000\nprincipal = payment * AF\n\n\nLet’s also answer a fourth question, which might occasionally arise:\n\nI know what the term of the loan will be, how much I want to borrow, how much I can afford to pay, and what the rate will be. If my payments aren’t enough, and I can get a balloon structure (a final payoff at maturity), how much will the balloon be?\n\nIf there is a balloon structure, then the loan principal equals the present value of the non-balloon payments (\\(\\text{payment} \\times \\text{AF}\\)) plus the present value of the balloon, which is \\[\\text{balloon} \\times \\frac{1}{(1+r/12)^{12n}}.\\] Thus, \\[\\text{balloon} = \\left(1+\\frac{r}{12}\\right)^{12n} \\times (\\text{principal} - \\text{payment} \\times AF)\\] This is the future value of the present value “shortage;” that is, it is the future value of the loan amount in excess of the present value of the monthly payments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing numpy-financial\n\n\n\nHere are the answers to all four questions, using functions from numpy-financial. The sign conventions are that the loan principal is positive (a cash inflow) and loan payments (regular payments and balloon) are negative. If the balloon calculation turns out to be positive, it means we’ve overpaid the bank and should get money back. We can include a balloon when answering the first three questions by setting, for example, fv=-100000 when the balloon is $100,000.\nimport numpy_financial as npf\nn = 30     # number of years\n\n# question 1\nr, principal = 0.04, 500000\npayment = npf.pmt(rate=r/12, nper=n*12, pv=principal, fv=0)\n \n# question 2\nr, payment = 0.04, -2000\nprincipal = npf.pv(rate=r/12, nper=n*12, pmt=payment, fv=0)\n \n# question 3\nprincipal, payment = 500000, -2000\nrate = 12*npf.rate(nper=n*12, pv=principal, pmt=payment, fv=0)\n \n# question 4\nr, principal, payment = 0.04, 500000, -2000\nballoon = npf.fv(rate=r/12, nper=n*12, pmt=payment, pv=amount)\n\n\nADD AMORTIZATION TABLE"

    "text": "1.6 Inflation and real returns\nIn the decade 1971–1980, the U.S. stock market returned an average of 9.2% per year. A dollar invested at the first of January in 1971 would have grown to $2.40 by the end of December in 1980. As decades go, this is quite far from the worst for the U.S. stock market.1 However, the 1970’s were a time of high inflation. What was the market performance in real terms? To be more precise, if we had invested $1 at the begining of January, 1971, by how much would our real buying power have grown by the end of December, 1980? In other words, what was our return in constant dollars? We will see here how to answer these questions.\nThe standard measure of the inflation rate is the percent change in a price index. In the U.S., the standard price index used for this calculation is the Consumer Price Index – All Urban calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It represents the cost of a basket of goods sampled in 87 urban areas across the U.S. To have 7% inflation in a year means that the basket of goods costs 7% more at the end of the year than at the beginning, or in other words that \\[\\frac{\\text{CPI at end of year}}{\\text{CPI at beginning of year}} = 1.07.\\]\nConsider an item that costs $100 today. Suppose there is 7% inflation in the coming year, and the item costs $107 at the end of the year. Suppose also that our portfolio earns 10% in the year. To calculate our real return, consider each $100 that we have at the start of the year. Each $100 could buy one item. In a year’s time, the $100 grows to $110, and the item costs $107, so we could buy one and have $3 left over, which would buy 3/107 units. This 3/107 is the growth in our buying power relative to the start of the year, so our real return is 3/107.\nWe can express the calculation in the previous paragraph in more generality as \\[\\text{real return} = \\frac{\\text{nominal return} - \\text{inflation rate}}{1 + \\text{inflation rate}},\\] where the nominal return is the return before adjustment for inflation (10% in our example) and all returns and rates are in decimal form. We also call the real return the return in constant dollars.\nWe can compound real returns the same way we compounded returns earlier. Let \\(r\\) denote the real return, \\(i\\) denote the inflation rate, and \\(z\\) denote the nominal return (all in decimal form). Adding 1 to both sides of the equation for the real return gives \\[1+r = \\frac{z-i}{1+i} + 1 = \\frac{1+z}{1+i}.\\] To calculate what $1 grows to in constant dollars over a period of \\(n\\) years, we calculate \\[(1+r_1)(1+r_2) \\cdots (1+r_n)\\] where the \\(r_i\\) are the real returns. By the above formula, \\[(1+r_1) \\cdots (1+r_n) = \\frac{(1+z_1) \\cdots (1+z_n)}{(1+i_1) \\cdots (1+i_n)}.\\] The numerator on the right hand side is what $1 grows to in nominal dollars. The denominator is the growth in the price index. To be specific, the denominator is \\[\\frac{\\text{CPI at end of year $n$}}{\\text{CPI at beginning of year 1}}.\\] Thus, the real return over a period of years equals the nominal return over the period with the growth in the CPI divided out.\nTo come back to our example – over the decade 1971–1980, $1 invested in the U.S. stock market grew to $2.40 in nominal terms, as stated earlier. However, the CPI at the end of the decade was 2.3 times its value at the beginning of the decade. In other words, compounded inflation \\((1+i_1) \\cdots (1+i_n)\\) over the decade was 2.3. So, the dollar grew to only 2.40 / 2.30 = 1.04 dollars in real terms, meaning that the total real return over the decade was only 4%. So, it was a middling decade in nominal terms and a very poor decade in real terms."

    "text": "1.7 Geometric average returns\nThe actual returns of the U.S. market over the decade 1971–1980 were\n\n1971 = 16.17%\n1972 = 16.89%\n1973 = –19.25%\n1974 = –27.75%\n1975 = 38.24%\n1976 = 26.99%\n1977 = –3.14%\n1978 = 8.21%\n1979 = 23.47%\n1980 = 33.37%\n\nThe average of these ten numbers is 11.32%. So, why did we say in the previous section that the market averaged 9.2% in the decade? The reason is that, if we had been invested throughout the decade, our return would have been exactly the same as if we earned 9.2% each year; that is, \\[(1+r_{\\text{1971}}) \\cdots (1+r_{\\text{1980}}) = 2.40 = 1.092^{10}.\\] However, we should be more precise in our language. The correct thing to say is that the geometric average return in the decade was 9.2%. The general definition of the geometric average of a sequence of returns \\(r_1, \\ldots, r_n\\) is that it is the number \\(r\\) such that \\[(1+r)^n = (1+r_1) \\cdots (1+r_n).\\] In other words, $1 grows to the same amount in an account that earns the returns \\(r_1, \\ldots, r_n\\) as it does when earning \\(r\\) each period. When there is a risk of confusion, we will call the usual average (0.1132 for 1971–1980) the arithmetic average return. Both averages have their uses, as we will see in subsequent chapters.\nIf there is any variability in the returns from period to period, then the geometric average is smaller than the arithmetic average, and the difference between the two is larger when returns are more variable. The substantial variability in the 1970’s produced the more than 2% difference between the two for that decade.\nAn even more extreme example is Tesla (TSLA), which fell by roughly 50% between November 2021 and May 2022 and then gained roughly 50% between May 2022 and August 2022.2 Were Tesla shareholders back to even? No, each $100 of Tesla stock fell to $50 and then gained 50% on $50 to get back only to $75, for an overall 25% loss. The arithmetic average of 0 in this case substantially overstates the actual experience of Tesla shareholders. The geometric average over these two periods is \\(\\sqrt{(1-0.5)(1+0.5)} - 1 = -0.134\\). This reflects the fact that if you lose 13.4% twice in a row, then you have lost 25%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric average and continuously compounded returns\n\n\n\nThe term “geometric average” is not unique to finance, but it is used a little differently in finance than elsewhere. Using the term in its non-finance meaning, the relationship \\[(1+r)^n = (1+r_1) \\cdots (1+r_n)\\] would be described by saying that \\(1+r\\) is the geometric average of the \\(1+r_1, \\ldots, 1+r_n\\). This is a little cumbersome to say, so in finance we simply say that \\(r\\) is the geometric average of the \\(r_i\\). To see in what sense this relationship represents an average, take the natural logarithm of both sides. This produces \\[n \\log (1+r) = \\log (1+r_1) + \\cdots \\log (1+r_n)\\] or, equivalently, \\[\\log (1+r) = \\frac{\\log (1+r_1) + \\cdots + \\log (1+r_n)}{n}.\\] Thus, “geometric average” means “average in logs.” As discussed earlier, these logarithms of one-plus-returns are called continuously compounded returns, so “geometric average” means a normal (arithmetic) average for continuously compounded returns. For example, suppose an asset drops by 50% and then has a 100% return, getting back to even. The continuously compounded returns are \\(\\log (1-0.5) = \\log 0.5\\) and \\(\\log (1+1) = \\log 2\\), and it is indeed true that \\(\\log 0.5 + \\log 2 = 0\\), so the average continuously compounded return represents the true experience of the asset – it broke even."

    "text": "1.8 Retirement planning\nLet’s put some things together to address an important problem: planning for retirement. We may already have some funds in an investment account, and we plan to make additional deposits monthly. At some point, we’ll start making withdrawals monthly. All the while, the funds in the account earn some rate of return. For simplicity, let’s assume that the return is the same each month. We’ll look at simulating random returns in the next section. We’ll also ignore taxes here, deferring that discussion to a later chapter.\nLet’s use a real monthly rate of return. Denote it by \\(r\\). It should be something like a half percent (\\(r=0.005\\)), though that would come with risk, which we are ignoring here. Also, let’s input the future deposits and withdrawals in today’s dollars.\nLet \\(B_0\\) denote the funds in the account today. At the end of a month, we’ll make our first deposit \\(D_1\\). Our account will grow during the month due to the investment return \\(rB_0\\) and the deposit, so our balance at the end of the first month will be \\[B_1 = (1+r)B_0 + D_1.\\] The date subscripts correspond to month-ends: \\(B_1\\) is the balance at the end of month 1, etc. The account continues to grow monthly as \\[B_i = (1+r)B_{i-1} + D_i\\] until the date of our last deposit. Call this date \\(m\\), so there are \\(m\\) months of deposits. In other words, we plan to work for \\(m\\) more months and then retire.\nTo finance our spending during the first month of retirement (month \\(m+1\\)), we’ll make a withdrawal at the beginning of the month, which is again date \\(m\\) (beginning of month \\(m+1\\) = end of month \\(m\\)). So, we make both a deposit and a withdrawal at date \\(m\\) (of course, we would really only make the net deposit or withdrawal), producing \\[B_m = (1+r)B_{m-1} + D_m - W_m.\\] Subsequently, we make only withdrawals, so \\[B_i = (1+r)B_{i-1} - W_i\\] until the last month. Call this month \\(n\\), so there are \\(n\\) total months. We make a withdrawal at the beginning of month \\(n\\), which is date \\(n-1\\), producing \\[B_{n-1} = (1+r)B_{n-2} - W_{n-1},\\] and if there is anything remaining in the account at that time it earns a final return in the last month, producing a “bequest” of \\[B_n = (1+r)B_{n-1}.\\]\nWe probably expect our income to grow in real terms during our working years, so let’s assume the deposits grow in real terms at some constant rate \\(g\\). Thus, we need to input \\(D_1\\) and then calculate \\(D_2 = (1+g)D_1\\), \\(D_3 = (1+g)D_2\\), etc. It’s not clear whether where our withdrawals should grow in real terms over time or decline, so let’s assume they are a constant amount \\(W\\). Thus, the inputs are \\(m\\), \\(n\\), \\(r\\), \\(B_0\\), \\(g\\), \\(D_1\\), and \\(W\\). Figure 1.3 presents an example.

    "text": "2.1 Portfolios of Two Risky Assets\nConsider forming a portfolio of two risky assets. To fix ideas, let’s consider these to be a US stock market fund and an international stock market fund. Unless otherwise stated, we will assume that portfolios are fully invested; that is, that the sum of the weights equal 1. If we invest all of our capital in some combination of these two assets, what are the expected returns and standard deviations of all the potential portfolios? Assume for now that we cannot short sell either asset; that is, the fraction invested in each must be non-negative.\nThe return of a two-asset portfolio is the weighted sum of the returns of the underlying assets: \\[ r_p = w  r_{\\text{US}} + (1-w) r_{\\text{intl}} \\,,  \\tag{2.1}\\] where \\(w\\) is the portfolio weight in the US stock fund. The expected return of the portfolio is: \\[ E[r_p] = w \\cdot  E[r_{\\text{US}}] + (1-w) E[r_{\\text{intl}}]\\,. \\tag{2.2}\\]\nWe will characterize the riskiness of portfolios using either variance or standard deviation. The portfolio return variance is a measure of dispersion or riskiness in the return distribution for the portfolio. It is defined as the expected (squared) magnitude of deviations in the portfolio return from its expected value: \\[ \\text{var}[r_p] = E\\big[(r_p-E[r_p])^2\\big]. \\tag{2.3}\\] As shown in the callout box, we can write the portfolio variance in terms of the individual asset variances and their covariance: \\[ w^2 \\text{var}[r_{\\text{US}}] + (1-w)^2 \\text{var}[r_{\\text{intl}}] + 2 w (1-w) \\text{cov}[r_{\\text{US}},r_{\\text{intl}}].  \\tag{2.4}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeriving two-asset portfolio variance\n\n\n\n\n\nTo derive Equation 2.4, first rewrite the portfolio return and expected return on the right-hand side of Equation 2.3 using Equation 2.1 and Equation 2.2 and group terms. Portfolio variance thus equals \\[ E\\big[\\left( w (r_{\\text{US}} - E[r_{\\text{US}}])+ (1-w) (r_{\\text{intl}}-E[r_{\\text{intl}}])\\right)^2\\big]. \\] Expanding the squared sum, we see that portfolio variance equals: \\[\\begin{align*}\n   &w^2 E\\big[(r_{\\text{US}}- E[r_{\\text{US}}])^2\\big] \\\\\n&+ (1-w)^2 E\\big[(r_{\\text{intl}}-E[r_{\\text{intl}}])^2\\big] \\\\\n&+ 2 w (1-w) E\\big[(r_{\\text{US}} - E[r_{\\text{US}}])(r_{\\text{intl}}-E[r_{\\text{intl}}])\\big].\n\\end{align*}\\] We arrive at Equation 2.4 by substituting in the definitions of variances of each asset and their covariance.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can express portfolio variance in terms of the individual asset risks and their correlation \\(\\rho\\): \\[ w^2 \\text{var}[r_{\\text{US}}] + (1-w)^2 \\text{var}[r_{\\text{intl}]} + 2 w (1-w) \\rho \\cdot \\text{sd}[r_{\\text{US}}]\\text{sd}[r_{\\text{intl}}] ,  \\tag{2.5}\\] where we used the fact that the covariance of two assets equals their correlation multiplied by the product of their standard deviations. The correlation between US stocks and stocks from developed international economies was about 75% over the last thirty years. Figure 2.1 plots the possible portfolios of the US and international stock funds. Investing in the US stock market fund alone is dominated by a combination of the two funds. It is possible to form a portfolio with less risk than investing 100% in the US fund. This is diversification in action. Moreover, these portfolios all have higher expected returns than does investing in the US fund alone.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\n#Based on French data library return series\n# Asset 1: US Equity\n# Asset 2: Developed International\n# Asset 1: Emerging Market\nmn1= 6\nmn2= 6.5\nsd1= 15\nsd2= 16.5 \ncorr12 = 75 \n\n\ndef data(mn1, mn2, sd1, sd2, c):\n    c = c / 100\n    mns = [mn1, mn2]\n    sds = [sd1, sd2]\n    grid = np.linspace(0, 1, 101)\n    ports = [np.array([w, 1 - w]) for w in grid]\n    means = [p.T @ np.array(mns) for p in ports]\n    df = pd.DataFrame(means)\n    df.columns = [\"mean\"]\n    cov = np.array(\n        [[sds[0] ** 2, sds[0] * sds[1] * c], [sds[0] * sds[1] * c, sds[1] ** 2]]\n    ).reshape(2, 2)\n    df[\"stdev\"] = [np.sqrt(p.T @ cov @ p) for p in ports]\n    df[\"wt1\"] = grid\n    df[\"wt2\"] = 1 - df.wt1\n    for col in [\"mean\", \"stdev\"]:\n        df[col] = df[col] / 100\n    return df\n\n\ndef figtbl(mn1, mn2, sd1, sd2, c,asset1_name, asset2_name):\n\n    df = data(mn1, mn2, sd1, sd2, c)\n    string0 = \"Correlation = \" +str(np.round(c,1)) + \"%\"\n    trace0 = go.Scatter(\n        x=df[\"stdev\"],\n        y=df[\"mean\"],\n        mode=\"lines\",\n        text=100 * df[\"wt1\"],\n        customdata=100 * df[\"wt2\"],\n        hovertemplate=string0 + \"<br>\"+asset1_name + \": %{text:.0f}%<br>\"+asset2_name + \": %{customdata:.0f}%<extra></extra>\",\n        name=\"Frontier: \" + asset1_name + \" + \" + asset2_name, \n        line=dict(color=\"red\"), \n    )\n\n    # Plot the two assets\n    df = df[df.wt1.isin([0, 1])]\n    df[\"text\"] = np.where(df.wt1 == 1, asset1_name, asset2_name)\n    trace1 = go.Scatter(\n        x=df[df.wt1==1][\"stdev\"],\n        y=df[df.wt1==1][\"mean\"],\n        mode=\"markers\",\n        text=df[df.wt1==1][\"text\"],\n        hovertemplate=\"%{text}<extra></extra>\",\n        marker=dict(size=15, color=\"black\"),\n        name=asset1_name\n    )\n    trace2 = go.Scatter(\n        x=df[df.wt1==0][\"stdev\"],\n        y=df[df.wt1==0][\"mean\"],\n        mode=\"markers\",\n        text=df[df.wt1==0][\"text\"],\n        hovertemplate=\"%{text}<extra></extra>\",\n        marker=dict(size=15, color=\"blue\"),\n        name=asset2_name\n    )\n\n\n    fig = go.Figure()\n    fig.add_trace(trace0)\n    fig.add_trace(trace1)\n    fig.add_trace(trace2)\n    fig.layout.xaxis[\"title\"] = \"Standard Deviation\"\n    fig.layout.yaxis[\"title\"] = \"Expected Return\"\n    fig.update_xaxes(range=[0.85 * df[\"stdev\"].min(), 1.15 * df[\"stdev\"].max()])\n    fig.update_yaxes(range=[0.85 * df[\"mean\"].min(), 1.15 * df[\"mean\"].max()])\n    fig.update_yaxes(tickformat=\".1%\")\n    fig.update_xaxes(tickformat=\".1%\")\n    fig.update_layout(legend=dict(yanchor=\"top\", y=0.99, xanchor=\"left\", x=0.01))\n    fig.show()\nfigtbl(mn1,mn2,sd1,sd2,corr12,\"US Equity\", \"Developed Intl\")\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 2.1: Portfolios of two risky assets\n\n\n\nDiversification benefits are greater when the assets are less correlated.

Each of the blue dots represent a different possible combination of the three portfolios. The lines connecting pairs of the assets show all possible portfolios of investing just in those two assets. The diversification benefits of adding a third asset to any of the pairs of assets can be seen by the fact that many of the blue three-asset portfolios lie to the left of the two-asset frontiers. That is, adding a third asset can produce a portfolio with the same expected return but lower portfolio risk than can be achieved with just two assets.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import uniform\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\n#Based on French return series\n# Asset 1: US Equity\n# Asset 2: Developed International\n# Asset 1: Emerging Market\nmn1= 6\nmn2= 6.5\nmn3= 8\nsd1= 15\nsd2= 16.5 \nsd3= 21\ncorr12 = 75 \ncorr13 = 75 \ncorr23 = 75 \n\ndef random_wts(num):\n    w = uniform.rvs(0, 1, num)\n    return w / w.sum()\n\nports = [random_wts(3) for i in range(3000)]\nports1 = [(0, x, 1 - x) for x in np.linspace(0, 1, 21)]\nports2 = [(x, 0, 1 - x) for x in np.linspace(0, 1, 21)]\nports3 = [(x, 1 - x, 0) for x in np.linspace(0, 1, 21)]\nports = ports + ports1 + ports2 + ports3\n\nports23 = ports1\nports13 = ports2\nports12 = ports3\n\ndef is_pos_def(x):\n    if np.all(np.linalg.eigvals(x) > 0):\n        return 'True'\n    else:\n        return 'False'\n\ndef data(mn1, mn2, mn3, sd1, sd2, sd3, c12, c13, c23):\n    mns = pd.Series(np.array([mn1, mn2, mn3]), index=[\"stock1\", \"stock2\", \"stock3\"])\n    sds = np.array([sd1, sd2, sd3])\n    C = np.diag([1.0, 1.0, 1.0])\n    C[0, 1] = c12 / 100\n    C[0, 2] = c13 / 100\n    C[1, 0] = c12 / 100\n    C[1, 2] = c23 / 100\n    C[2, 0] = c13 / 100\n    C[2, 1] = c23 / 100\n    D = np.diag(sds / 100)\n    C = D @ C @ D\n    \n    #

If the investor is restricted to hold only a single asset, they must hold the domestic international fund with risk of over 16% per year. If an investor can hold two assets, they could lower the amount of risk by holding a portfolio of the US stock fund and the emerging market fund and reduce the portfolio risk to below 16% per year. An additional diversification benefit is possible if the investor holds all three assets; an even lower standard deviation can be achieved for the same expected return."

    "text": "2.3 Portfolios with Many Assets\nAdding more securities to a portfolio results in additional diversification benefits, but the marginal benefit of an additional security decreases with the total number of securities in the portfolio. We discussed above that the diversification benefit in a two-asset case depends on the correlation between the two security returns. For portfolios of many assets, the portfolio variance depends more on the average correlation across securities than it does on the riskiness of the securities themselves.\nThe riskiness of an \\(N\\)-asset portfolio, as measured by the portfolio variance, is: \\[ \\text{var}[r_p] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i^2 \\text{var}[r_i] + 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j>i} w_i w_j \\text{cov}[r_i,r_j]\\,,  \\tag{2.8}\\] which can be derived in the same way as the two-asset variance in Equation 2.4, albeit with more algebra. Calculating each term in the last line of Equation 2.8 and adding them up can quickly become tedious. Given a covariance matrix \\(V\\): \\[\\begin{equation*}\n    V =\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n        \\text{var}[r_1]     & \\text{cov}[r_1,r_2] & \\dots  & \\text{cov}[r_1,r_N] \\\\\n        \\text{cov}[r_2,r_1] & \\text{var}[r_2]     & \\dots  & \\text{cov}[r_2,r_N] \\\\\n        \\vdots              & \\vdots              & \\ddots &  \\vdots \\\\\n        \\text{cov}[r_N,r_1] & \\text{cov}[r_N,r_2] & \\dots  & \\text{var}[r_N] \\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation*}\\] and a vector of portfolio weights \\[w'=[w_1\\, w_2\\,...\\,w_N]\\,,\\] we can calculate the portfolio variance as the matrix product \\[ \\text{var}[r_p] = w'Vw \\,. \\tag{2.9}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating Portfolio Risk\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven an array of weights, calculating the portfolio variance in python is easy using matrix multiplication in numpy. Note the inputs below are decimal notation. Multiply the standard deviations and correlations by 100 to get percents. Two methods for creating a covariance matrix are demonstrated. The first demonstrates entry element-by-element, and the second more elegantly (and concisely) uses matrix multiplication using the array of standard deviations and the correlation matrix.\nimport numpy as np\n\n##### Inputs\n# Standard deviations\nsds = np.array([0.20, 0.12, 0.15])\n\n# Correlations\ncorr12 = 0.3\ncorr13 = 0.3\ncorr23 = 0.3\n\n# Portfolio weights\nwgts = np.array([0.25, 0.5, 0.25])\n\n##### Method 1 to calculate covariance matrix\n# Covariances\ncov12 = corr12 * sds[0] * sds[1]\ncov13 = corr13 * sds[0] * sds[2]\ncov23 = corr23 * sds[1] * sds[2]\n# Covariance matrix\ncov = np.array([[sds[0]**2,  cov12,     cov13], \\\n                [cov12,      sds[1]**2, cov23], \\\n                [cov13,      cov23,     sds[2]**2]])\n\n##### Method 2 to calculate covariance matrix\n# Correlation matrix\nC  = np.identity(3)\nC[0, 1] = C[1, 0] = corr12\nC[0, 2] = C[2, 0] = corr13\nC[1, 2] = C[2, 1] = corr23\n# Covariance matrix\ncov = np.diag(sds) @ C @ np.diag(sds)\n\n##### Portfolio risk measures\n#Portfolio variance\nport_var = wgts @ cov @ wgts\n\n#Portfolio standard deviation\nport_sd  = np.sqrt(port_var)\n\n\n\nAverage correlation across assets is important for the possible diversification benefits in large portfolios. This is due to the sheer number of terms in the portfolio variance calculation Equation 2.8 involving correlations (through the covariance terms). We can visualize each term of the portfolio variance in matrix form. For instance, the three-asset version of Equation 2.8 in matrix form is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(w_1^2 \\text{var}[r_1]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_1 w_2 \\text{cov}[r_1,r_2]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_1 w_3 \\text{cov}[r_1,r_3]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(w_2 w_1 \\text{cov}[r_2,r_1]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_2^2 \\text{var}[r_2]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_2 w_3 \\text{cov}[r_2,r_3]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(w_3 w_1 \\text{cov}[r_3,r_1]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_3 w_2 \\text{cov}[r_3,r_2]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_3^2 \\text{var}[r_3]\\)\n\n\n\n\nFor the three-asset portfolio, there are 3 variance terms and 3 distinct covariance terms. For a five-asset portfolio, the tabular representation of Equation 2.8 is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(w_1^2 \\text{var}[r_1]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_1 w_2 \\text{cov}[r_1,r_2]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_1 w_3 \\text{cov}[r_1,r_3]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_1 w_4 \\text{cov}[r_1,r_4]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_1 w_5 \\text{cov}[r_1,r_5]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(w_2 w_1 \\text{cov}[r_2,r_1]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_2^2 \\text{var}[r_2]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_2 w_3 \\text{cov}[r_2,r_3]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_2 w_4 \\text{cov}[r_2,r_4]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_2 w_5 \\text{cov}[r_2,r_5]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(w_3 w_1 \\text{cov}[r_3,r_1]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_3 w_2 \\text{cov}[r_3,r_2]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_3^2 \\text{var}[r_3]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_3 w_4 \\text{cov}[r_3,r_4]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_3 w_5 \\text{cov}[r_3,r_5]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(w_4 w_1 \\text{cov}[r_4,r_1]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_4 w_2 \\text{cov}[r_4,r_2]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_4 w_3 \\text{cov}[r_4,r_3]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_4^2 \\text{var}[r_4]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_4 w_5 \\text{cov}[r_4,r_5]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(w_5 w_1 \\text{cov}[r_5,r_1]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_5 w_2 \\text{cov}[r_5,r_2]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_5 w_3 \\text{cov}[r_5,r_3]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_5 w_4 \\text{cov}[r_5,r_4]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_5^2 \\text{var}[r_5]\\)\n\n\n\n\nFor the five-asset portfolio, there are 5 variance terms (along the diagonal) and 10 =((25-5)/2) distinct covariance terms. For an \\(N\\) asset portfolio, there will be \\(N\\) variance terms and \\(\\frac{N^2-N}{2}\\) distinct covariance terms. For portfolios with many assets, the number of covariance terms will quickly dwarf the number of variance terms.\nTo see how correlation across assets can dominate the riskiness of individual securities in portfolios with many assets, consider an equally-weighted (\\(w_i=1/N\\) for all assets) portfolio where all assets have the same variance \\((\\sigma^2_{\\text{all}})\\) and all pairs of assets have the same covariance \\((\\overline{\\text{cov}})\\). The variance of this equal-weighted portfolio is the sum of the \\(N\\) variance terms and \\(N^2-N\\) covariance terms: \\[  N\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)^2 \\sigma^2_{\\text{all}} + (N^2-N)\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)^2 \\overline{\\text{cov}}\\,. \\] Simplifying, the portfolio variance is: \\[ \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right) \\sigma^2_{\\text{all}} + \\left(1-\\frac{1}{N}\\right) \\overline{\\text{cov}}\\,. \\] As the number of assets \\(N\\) gets very large, the portfolio variance approaches the common covariance across assets: \\[ \\text{var}(r_p) \\underset{N\\rightarrow \\infty}{\\longrightarrow} 0\\cdot\\sigma^2_{\\text{all}}+(1-0)\\overline{\\text{cov}}=\\overline{\\text{cov}}\\,. \\tag{2.10}\\]\nFigure 2.3 plots the portfolio variance for this equally-weighted portfolio as a function of the number of assets for three correlation values. The figure demonstrates three insights. First, as discussed previously, the diversification benefit is greater for lower levels of correlation across assets (that is, lower \\(\\overline{\\text{cov}}\\) here). Second, the marginal benefit of adding additional securities to a portfolio decreases with the number of securities. A large fraction of the overall risk reduction is due to the first 10 to 20 securities added to the portfolio. Third, there is a limit to risk reduction, and this limit is governed by the amount of common comovement across assets in the portfolio. \\(\\sigma_{\\text{all}}\\) is assumed to be 40%, so Equation 2.10 tells us that the portfolio standard deviation approaches values of 12.6%, 20%, and 28.3%, respectively, for correlations of 10%, 25%, and 50% as the number of portfolio assets gets large.1 Figure 2.3 shows that for portfolios of 200 assets, the portfolio standard deviation is already quite close to these limiting standard deviations.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\nstd  = 40\ncorr0 = 10\ncorr1 = 25\ncorr2 = 50\n\n# Range of x-axis\nNum = 200\n\ndef data(std, cor):\n    var = std ** 2\n    cov = var * cor\n    stdevs = [np.sqrt(var / n + (n - 1) * cov / n) for n in range(1, Num + 1)]\n    df = pd.DataFrame(stdevs)\n    df.columns = [\"Standard Deviation\"]\n    df[\"Number of Assets\"] = [i for i in range(1, Num + 1)]\n    return df\ndef figtbl(std, cor0, cor1, cor2):\n    # The inputs are in percents\n    std /= 100\n    cor0 /= 100\n    cor1 /= 100\n    cor2 /= 100\n\n    # Correlation 0\n    df = data(std, cor0)\n    trace0 = go.Scatter(\n        x=df[\"Number of Assets\"],\n        y=df[\"Standard Deviation\"],\n        mode=\"lines\",\n        hovertemplate=\"Correlation=\" + f'{100*cor0:.0f}%' + \"<br>Number of Assets = %{x}<br>Standard Deviation = %{y:0.2%} <extra></extra>\",\n        name = \"Correlation=\" + f'{100*cor0:.0f}%'\n    )\n\n    # Correlation 1\n    df = data(std, cor1)\n    trace1 = go.Scatter(\n        x=df[\"Number of Assets\"],\n        y=df[\"Standard Deviation\"],\n        mode=\"lines\",\n        hovertemplate=\"Correlation=\" + f'{100*cor1:.0f}%' + \"<br>Number of Assets = %{x}<br>Standard Deviation = %{y:0.2%} <extra></extra>\",\n        name = \"Correlation=\" + f'{100*cor1:.0f}%'\n    )   \n    # Correlation 2\n    df = data(std, cor2)\n    trace2 = go.Scatter(\n        x=df[\"Number of Assets\"],\n        y=df[\"Standard Deviation\"],\n        mode=\"lines\",\n        hovertemplate=\"Correlation=\" + f'{100*cor2:.0f}%' + \"<br>Number of Assets = %{x}<br>Standard Deviation = %{y:0.2%} <extra></extra>\",\n        name = \"Correlation=\" + f'{100*cor2:.0f}%'\n    )      \n\n    fig = go.Figure()\n    fig.add_trace(trace0)\n    fig.add_trace(trace1)\n    fig.add_trace(trace2)\n    fig.update_yaxes(tickformat=\",.0%\", rangemode=\"tozero\")\n    fig.layout.xaxis[\"title\"] = \"Number of Assets\"\n    fig.layout.yaxis[\"title\"] = \"Standard Deviation\"\n    fig.update_layout(legend=dict(yanchor=\"top\", y =0.99, xanchor=\"left\", x=0.74))\n    fig.show()\n    \nfigtbl(std, corr0, corr1, corr2)\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 2.3: Portfolios of three risky assets"

    "text": "2.4 Short-Sales\nSo far, we have considered portfolios with nonnegative weights in each of the assets. Negative portfolio weights correspond to short positions in a portfolio. Short-selling involves borrowing a security from another owner and selling it. The short-seller then has a liability to return the security to the security lender; this liability is equal to the security’s market value. Short-sellers hope to purchase the security later for a lower price. Thus, they reverse the order of the investing maxim: buy low-sell high. Short-sellers hope to sell high-buy low. In practice, there are limitations on short selling: it may not be possible to use the proceeds from a short sale to buy other risky assets, less than full interest may be earned on the proceeds, and a fee must be paid to borrow the asset being shorted. In this section, we ignore those issues. We assume that proceeds from short sales are invested in the other risky assets.\nFigure 2.4 shows the expected returns and risks of portfolios of the US stock fund and the developed international fund when shorting is allowed.

    "text": "2.5 The Efficient Frontier\nWith more than two risky assets, multiple portfolios can achieve the same expected return, but with different amounts of portfolio risk. This was seen above in Figure 2.2. All else equal, typical investors like expected return and dislike risk, so for a given expected return level, lower levels of portfolio standard deviation are preferred. For each level of expected return, we can find the portfolio that provides the highest possible diversification, that is, the lowest standard deviation. The set of these minimum-variance portfolios is called the frontier. The portfolio with the lowest standard deviation across all feasible expected returns is called the global minimum variance (GMV) portfolio. Portfolios that lie on the frontier with expected returns above those of the GMV portfolio are said to be efficient, and this portion of the frontier is called the efficient frontier. For the discussion below, we assume that short-sales are allowed. We will relax this assumption in a later chapter.\nMathematically, the GMV portfolio is the set of portfolio weights that minimizes portfolio variance without conditioning on the portfolio expected return: \\[ \\underset{w_1,w_2,\\dots,w_N}{\\text{min}} \\text{var}[r_p] \\tag{2.11}\\] subject to the constraints \\(\\sum_i w_i=1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating the GMV portfolio\n\n\n\n\n\nIf short sales are allowed, the GMV portfolio weights satisfy a system of equations. The vector of GMV portfolio weights \\(w\\) has the same inner product with each column of the covariance matrix \\(\\text{cov}_i\\) (\\(n-1\\) equations): \\[ \\frac{w'\\text{cov}_i}{w'\\text{cov}_j} = 1\\,,\\] and the portfolio is fully invested: \\[\\sum_i w_i = 1.\\]\nimport numpy as np\n\n##### Inputs\n# Standard deviations\nsds = np.array([0.20, 0.12, 0.15])\n# Correlations\ncorr12 = 0.3\ncorr13 = 0.3\ncorr23 = 0.3\n# Covariance matrix\nC  = np.identity(3)\nC[0, 1] = C[1, 0] = corr12\nC[0, 2] = C[2, 0] = corr13\nC[1, 2] = C[2, 1] = corr23\ncov = np.diag(sds) @ C @ np.diag(sds)\n\n##### Global Minimum Variance Portfolio\nn = len(sds)\nw = np.linalg.solve(cov, np.ones(n))\nwgts_gmv = w / np.sum(w)\n\n\n\nA frontier portfolio with expected return \\(\\mu_{\\text{target}}\\) is defined by the portfolio weights that solve the following constrained optimization problem: \\[ \\underset{w_1,w_2,\\dots,w_N}{\\text{min}} \\text{var}[r_p] \\tag{2.12}\\] subject to constraints: \\(E[r_p]=\\mu_{\\text{target}}\\) and \\(\\sum_i w_i=1\\).

    "text": "3.1 Capital Allocation with a Single Risky Asset\nWhat does the set of possible portfolios look like if we consider the US stock market index fund as the risky asset and Treasury bills as the risk-free asset? For a given portfolio weight in the risky asset \\(w\\), we first need to determine the portfolio’s expected return and standard deviation. Considering all possible risky portfolio weights traces out the set of possible investments, which is called the capital allocation line in expected return/standard deviation space.\nFrom Equation 2.4, the variance of portfolio \\(r_p\\) with non-negative \\(w\\) invested in the risky asset and \\(1-w\\) invested in the risk-free rate is: \\[\\text{var}[r_p]=w^2 \\text{var}[r_{\\text{risky}}]+ (1-w)^2 \\text{var}[r_f]+ 2 w(1-w) \\text{cov}[r_{\\text{risky}},r_f]\\,. \\] Note that the risk-free asset’s return is nonrandom (\\(\\text{var}[r_f]=0\\)) and thus does not covary with the risky asset return (\\(\\text{cov}[r_{\\text{risky}},r_f]=0\\)), so the portfolio variance simplifies to: \\[\\text{var}[r_p]=w^2 \\text{var}[r_{\\text{risky}}]\\,.\\] Thus, the portfolio’s standard deviation is: \\[ \\text{sd}[r_p] = w\\cdot \\text{sd}[r_{\\text{risky}}]\\,. \\tag{3.1}\\]\nThe expected return of the portfolio is: \\[ E[r_p] = w E[r_{\\text{risky}}]+ (1-w) r_f \\,. \\tag{3.2}\\] Solving Equation 3.1 for \\(w\\), substituting into Equation 3.2, and rearranging yields the relationship between expected return and standard deviation along the capital allocation line: \\[ E[r_p] = r_f + \\bigg[ \\frac{E[r_{\\text{risky}}]-r_f}{\\text{sd}[r_{\\text{risky}}] }\\bigg] \\cdot \\text{sd}[r_p] \\,. \\tag{3.3}\\] The capital allocation line for a risky asset is a set of portfolios combining the risky asset with the risk-free asset. In expected return/standard deviation space, the \\(y\\)-intercept is the risk-free rate of return and the slope of the line is the ratio of the expected excess return of the risky asset to its standard deviation. This ratio is called the Sharpe ratio, after Nobel laureate  William Sharpe . We discuss it in more detail below.\nFigure 4.1 shows the set of possible portfolios along the capital allocation line. Portfolios to the left of the market portfolio entail investing a fraction of wealth \\(w\\) in the market and the remainder is saved, earning interest at the risk-free rate. Portfolios to the right of the market portfolio are levered portfolios. These portfolios involve borrowing at the risk-free rate (a negative portfolio weight on the risk-free asset). Both the borrowed capital and the initial capital is invested in the market portfolio (\\(w>100\\%\\)).\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\n# Parameter values (in percent)\nmn = 6\nsd = 15\ns = 2\nextra = 0    #incremental borrowing rate\n\ndef data(mn, sd, s, b):\n    grid = np.linspace(0, 2, 201)\n    mns = [(s + w * (mn - s) if w <= 1 else b + w * (mn - b)) for w in grid]\n    sds = [w * sd for w in grid]\n    return grid, mns, sds\n\ndef figtbl(mn, sd, s, extra):\n    mn /= 100\n    sd /= 100\n    b = s+extra\n    s /= 100\n    b /= 100\n    grid, mns, sds = data(mn, sd, s, b)\n    df = pd.DataFrame({'grid': grid, 'mns': mns, 'sds': sds})\n    string = \"wealth in market = %{text:.0f}%<extra></extra>\"\n    trace1 = go.Scatter(\n        x=df[grid<=1].sds, y=df[grid<=1].mns, mode=\"lines\", text=100 * df[grid<=1].grid, hovertemplate=string, name='CAL (saving)', line=dict(color=\"blue\"),\n    )\n    string = \"wealth in market = %{text:.0f}%<extra></extra>\"\n    trace1a = go.Scatter(\n        x=df[grid>1].sds, y=df[grid>1].mns, mode=\"lines\", text=100 * df[grid>1].grid, hovertemplate=string, name='CAL (borrowing)', line=dict(color=\"blue\",dash='dot'),\n    )\n    string = \"wealth in market = 100%<extra></extra>\"\n    trace2 = go.Scatter(\n        x=[sd], y=[mn], mode=\"markers\", hovertemplate=string, marker=dict(size=15), name='Market'\n    )\n    string = \"wealth in market = 0%<extra></extra>\"\n    trace3 = go.Scatter(\n        x=[0], y=[s], mode=\"markers\", hovertemplate=string, marker=dict(size=15), name='Risk-free'\n    )  \n    # string = \"Borrowing rate<extra></extra>\"\n    # trace4 = go.Scatter(\n    #     x=[0], y=[b], mode=\"markers\", hovertemplate=string, marker=dict(size=15), name='Risk-free (Borrowing)'\n    # )       \n    fig = go.Figure()\n    fig.add_trace(trace1)\n    fig.add_trace(trace1a)\n    fig.add_trace(trace2)\n    fig.add_trace(trace3)\n    # fig.add_trace(trace4)\n    fig.layout.xaxis[\"title\"] = \"Standard Deviation\"\n    fig.layout.yaxis[\"title\"] = \"Expected Return\"\n    fig.update_yaxes(tickformat=\".0%\")\n    fig.update_xaxes(tickformat=\".0%\")\n    fig.update_layout(legend=dict(yanchor=\"top\", y =0.99, xanchor=\"left\", x=0.01))\n    fig.show()\nfigtbl(mn, sd, s, extra)\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 3.1: Capital Allocation Line"

    "text": "3.2 The Tangency Portfolio\nWhat if we can invest in multiple risky assets and the risk-free asset? What is the best way to form a portfolio in this case? Let’s assume that in addition to the US stock market fund, we are also considering investing in a long-term bond fund. Empirically, over the last 30 or 40 years, equities and long-term government bonds have been almost uncorrelated; we will use a correlation of -5% below.\nFirst, consider the investment opportunity sets that would obtain if we restricted attention to investing in only a single risky fund (either the stock or bond fund) in conjunction with the risk-free asset. The possible portfolios are the capital allocation lines for the stock fund and the bond fund, respectively. These are plotted as the orange and red lines in Figure 3.2. We can see immediately that all portfolios on the CAL for the stock fund are dominated by both the stock-bond frontier (the black line) and by the bond CAL (the red line). The same expected return can be achieved for smaller standard deviation.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\nmn_stock = 6 \nmn_bond  = 3.5\nsd_stock = 15\nsd_bond  = 3.5\ncorr = -5\n\nrs = 2\nextra = 0\n\ndef data(mn1, mn2, sd1, sd2, c, rs, extra):\n    c = c / 100\n    rb = rs + extra   \n    rs = rs/100\n    rb = rb/100\n    mns = [mn1, mn2]\n    sds = [sd1, sd2]\n    grid = np.linspace(-0.20, 1, 121)\n    ports = [np.array([w, 1 -

The Sharpe ratio is a measure of the excess return of an investment per unit of risk. Since investors like expected returns and dislike risk, they want high Sharpe ratios. Note in Figure 3.2 that the Sharpe ratio of the bond is higher than that of the stock portfolio. The highest possible Sharpe ratio is obtained by combining the risk-free asset with a risky portfolio so that the CAL slope is as high as possible. This occurs when the CAL is tangent to the curve of risky-only portfolios. This portfolio of risky assets is thus called the tangency portfolio. Investing along the CAL of the tangency portfolio offers the highest possible Sharpe ratio, regardless of any desired level of expected return or risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating the Tangency Portfolio\n\n\n\n\n\nIf short sales are allowed, the tangency portfolio weights satisfy a system of equations. The inner product of the tangency portfolio \\(w\\) with each column of the covariance matrix \\(\\text{cov}_i\\) is proportional to the asset’s risk premium \\(E[r_i]-r_f\\) (\\(n-1\\) equations): \\[ \\frac{w'\\text{cov}_i}{w'\\text{cov}_j} = \\frac{E[r_i]-r_f}{E[r_j]-r_f}\\,,\\] and the portfolio is fully invested: \\[\\sum_i w_i = 1.\\]\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n##### Inputs\n# Risk-free rate\nr = 0.02\n# Expected returns\nmns = np.array([0.10, 0.05, 0.07])\n# Standard deviations\nsds = np.array([0.20, 0.12, 0.15])\n# Correlations\ncorr12 = 0.3\ncorr13 = 0.3\ncorr23 = 0.3\n# Covariance matrix\nC  = np.identity(3)\nC[0, 1] = C[1, 0] = corr12\nC[0, 2] = C[2, 0] = corr13\nC[1, 2] = C[2, 1] = corr23\ncov = np.diag(sds) @ C @ np.diag(sds)\n\n##### Tangency Portfolio\nw = np.linalg.solve(cov, mns - r)\nwgts_tangency = w / np.sum(w)\n\n\n\nThe tangency portfolio is thus the optimal combination of risky assets, and all investors should invest somewhere along the tangency portfolio CAL. This is an example of the two-fund separation property of asset allocation. All investors will choose to allocate capital to the risk-free asset and an optimal risky asset portfolio. The problem of determining an optimal all-risky asset portfolio is separate from the choice of where to invest on the resulting capital allocation line. We discuss the latter decision of how much capital to allocate to risky assets relative to the risk-free asset in the rest of this section."

    "text": "3.3 Preferences over Risk and Return\nIn order to make statements about “optimal” portfolios, we need to describe the preferences of investors in some way. A standard way to do so is to use mean-variance utility. Simply put, we will assume that investors like higher expected returns and dislike portfolios with riskier returns. The amount of extra expected return needed for an investor to take on additional risk is governed by the investor’s risk aversion, which we will denote by \\(A\\).\nMathematically, mean-variance utility for a given portfolio return \\(r_p\\) is: \\[ U(r_p)=E[r_p] - 0.5\\cdot A \\cdot \\text{var}[r_p]\\,.\\] The utility of a risky investment is its expected return minus a penalty for variance. More risk averse investors have higher values for \\(A\\), meaning that they put greater penalties on variance. Figure 3.3 shows indifference curves for three different levels of risk aversion, but the same level of utility. When risk aversion is higher, a higher expected return is required to reach the utility for a given level of risk, and the extra expected return increases when risk increases.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Parameters\nraver1 = 2\nraver2 = 5\nraver3 = 10\nu1 = 0.10\nu2 = 0.10\nu3 = 0.10\nstring1='Risk Aversion='+str(raver1)\nstring2='Risk Aversion='+str(raver2)\nstring3='Risk Aversion='+str(raver3)\n\n# Generate data\nsd = np.arange(0,0.405,0.005)\nU1 = u1 + 0.5*raver1* (sd**2)\nU2 = u2 + 0.5*raver2* (sd**2) \nU3 = u3 + 0.5*raver3* (sd**2)\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data={'Standard Deviation': sd, string1: U1, string2: U2,string3: U3})\ndf = df*100\n\n# Plot data\nfig = px.line(df,x='Standard Deviation', y=[string1, string2, string3])\nfig.update_layout(title='',\n                   xaxis_title='Standard Deviation',\n                   yaxis_title='Expected Return',\n    legend_title_text='',)\nfig.update_yaxes(tickformat=\".0f\", ticksuffix=\"%\")\nfig.update_xaxes(tickformat=\".0f\", ticksuffix=\"%\")\nfig.update_layout(legend=dict(yanchor=\"top\", y =0.99, xanchor=\"left\", x=0.01))\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 3.3: Indifference curves with different levels of risk aversion\n\n\n\nInvestors are indifferent between portfolios that generate the same utility. Figure 3.4 shows three different levels of utility, holding risk aversion fixed. A utility of, for example, 10% means that the investor would be indifferent between the risky investment and a risk-free investment with a return of 10%. That is, any portfolio located on the green indifference curve in Figure 3.4 provides the same level of utility to this investor. Higher utility is achieved with either a higher expected return or lower risk or both.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\nimport plotly.express as px\n# import plotly.io as pio\n# pio.renderers.default='notebook'\n\n# Parameters\nraver = 10\nu1 = 0.05\nu2 = 0.075\nu3 = 0.10\nstring1='Utility='+str(np.round(u1*100,1))+'%'\nstring2='Utility='+str(np.round(u2*100,1))+'%'\nstring3='Utility='+str(np.round(u3*100,1))+'%'\n\n# Generate data\nsd = np.arange(0,0.405,0.005)\nU1 = u1 + 0.5*raver* (sd**2)\nU2 = u2 + 0.5*raver* (sd**2) \nU3 = u3 + 0.5*raver* (sd**2)\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data={'Standard Deviation': sd, string1: U1, string2: U2,string3: U3})\ndf = df*100\n\n# Plot data\nfig = px.line(df,x='Standard Deviation', y=[string1, string2, string3])\nfig.update_layout(title='',\n                   xaxis_title='Standard Deviation',\n                   yaxis_title='Expected Return',\n    legend_title_text='',)\nfig.update_yaxes(tickformat=\".0f\", ticksuffix=\"%\")\nfig.update_xaxes(tickformat=\".0f\", ticksuffix=\"%\")\nfig.update_layout(legend=dict(yanchor=\"top\", y =0.99, xanchor=\"left\", x=0.01))\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 3.4: Indifference curves with same level of risk aversion"

    "text": "3.4 Preferences and the Capital Allocation Line\nThe choice of where to locate along the CAL is the choice of how much to invest in a risky portfolio \\(w\\) (the other \\(1-w\\) being invested in a risk-free asset). A mean-variance investor chooses \\(w\\) to solve: \\[ \\underset{w}\\max E[r_p] - 0.5\\cdot A \\cdot \\text{var}[r_p]\\,.  \\tag{3.4}\\] with \\(r_p = w r_{\\text{risky}} + (1-w) r_{\\text{risky} r_f}\\). Plugging in the expected return (Equation 3.2) and standard deviation ( Equation 3.1) into Equation 3.4 and considering the first-order condition with respect to \\(w\\) provides the optimal weight to invest in the risky asset: \\[ w^* = \\frac{E[r_{\\text{risky}}-r_f]}{A \\cdot \\text{var}_{\\text{risky}}}\\,. \\tag{3.5}\\] Thus, an investor’s location on the CAL depends on risk aversion. Investors with different risk aversion will choose different combinations of the risky asset and the risk-free asset.\nWhile Equation 3.5 applies to the optimal capital allocation between any risky portfolio and the risk-free asset, the risky portfolio is usually some optimal combination of risky assets like the tangency portfolio. Thus, with multiple risky assets, asset allocation decisions are made in two steps. First, the optimal combination of risky assets, the tangency portfolio, is found. With the same set of inputs for expected returns, standard deviations, and correlations, all investors find the tangency portfolio to be the optimal risky portfolio. Second, investors choose how to allocate capital between the risky portfolio and the risk-free asset. Investors will differ in the fraction of their wealth to invest in the tangency portfolio relative to the risk-free asset because investors with different risk aversions will find different portfolios on the tangency portfolio capital allocation line to be better than others based on their own preferences.\nFigure 3.5 shows the indifference curves at the highest possible utility level for investors with the indicated risk aversions. Investors with lower risk aversion will choose portfolios further up the capital allocation line, accepting greater risk for higher expected returns.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\nmn_stock = 6\nmn_bond  = 3.5\nsd_stock = 15\nsd_bond  = 3.5\ncorr = -5\n\nrs = 2\nextra = 0\n\nraver1 = 6\nraver2 = 10\n\ndef data(mn1, mn2, sd1, sd2, c, rs, extra):\n    c = c / 100\n    rb = rs + extra   \n    rs = rs/100\n    rb = rb/100\n    mns = [mn1, mn2]\n    sds = [sd1, sd2]\n    grid = np.linspace(-0.2, 1, 121)\n    ports = [np.array([w, 1 -

Higher risk aversion translates into lower holdings of the tangency portfolio. For the assumed inputs, investors with risk aversions below about 15 would choose a levered position in the tangency portfolio. That is, they would find it optimal to borrow money and invest it and their initial investment wealth in the tangency portfolio.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\nmn_stock = 6\nmn_bond  = 3.5\nsd_stock = 15\nsd_bond  = 3.5\ncorr = -5\n\nrs = 2\nextra = 0\n\nraver1 = 2\nraver2 = 5\n\ndef data(mn1, mn2, sd1, sd2, c, rs, extra):\n    c = c / 100\n    rb = rs + extra   \n    rs = rs/100\n    rb = rb/100\n    mns = [mn1, mn2]\n    sds = [sd1, sd2]\n    grid = np.linspace(0, 1, 101)\n    ports = [np.array([w, 1 -

    "text": "4.1 Different Borrowing & Lending Rates\n\nKinked CALs\nThe capital allocation line is the set of expected returns and standard deviations formed by combining a single risky asset (or portfolio) with weight \\(w\\) and a risk-free asset with weight \\(1-w\\). In Chapter 3, we assumed a single risk-free rate. Any portfolios with \\(w>100\\%\\) involve borrowing at the risk-free rate (that is, issuing bonds at the same rate as, say, US Treasuries). This is probably not a reasonable assumption. For most investors, \\(r^{\\text{borrow}}>r^{\\text{saving}}\\). In this case, the capital allocation line is kinked at the risky-asset. For portfolios with some risk-free saving, the capital allocation line is the same as in Equation 3.3:\n\\[ E[r_p] = r_f^{\\text{saving}} + \\bigg[ \\frac{E[r_{\\text{risky}}]-r_f^{\\text{saving}}}{\\text{sd}[r_{\\text{risky}}] }\\bigg]\\cdot \\text{sd}[r_p]\\,.\\]\nFor portfolios with borrowing, the capital allocation line has a lower slope: \\[ E[r_p] = r_f^{\\text{borrow}} + \\bigg[ \\frac{E[r_{\\text{risky}}]-r_f^{\\text{borrow}}}{\\text{sd}[r_{\\text{risky}}] }\\bigg]\\cdot \\text{sd}[r_p]\\,.\\] Figure 4.1 shows the set of possible portfolios along the kinked capital allocation line with differential savings and borrowing rates. The black dotted lines extend the blue solid lines, but the points on the black dotted lines are infeasible, because they involve saving at the borrowing rate or borrowing at the savings rate.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\n# Parameter values (in percent)\nmn = 6\nsd = 15\ns = 2\nextra = 1.25    #incremental borrowing rate\n\ndef data(mn, sd, s, b):\n    grid = np.linspace(0, 2, 201)\n    mns = [(s + w * (mn - s) if w <= 1 else b + w * (mn - b)) for w in grid]\n    sds = [w * sd for w in grid]\n    mns_infeasible = [(s + w * (mn - s) if w > 1 else b + w * (mn - b)) for w in grid]\n    return grid, mns, sds, mns_infeasible\n\ndef figtbl(mn, sd, s, extra):\n    mn /= 100\n    sd /= 100\n    b = s+extra\n    s /= 100\n    b /= 100\n    grid, mns, sds, mns_infeasible = data(mn, sd, s, b)\n    df = pd.DataFrame({'grid': grid, 'mns': mns, 'sds': sds, 'mns_infeas':mns_infeasible})\n    string = \"wealth in market = %{text:.0f}%<extra></extra>\"\n    trace1 = go.Scatter(\n        x=df[grid<=1].sds, y=df[grid<=1].mns, mode=\"lines\", text=100 * df[grid<=1].grid, hovertemplate=string, name='CAL (saving)', line=dict(color=\"blue\"),\n    )\n    string = \"wealth in market = %{text:.0f}%<extra></extra>\"\n    trace1a = go.Scatter(\n        x=df[grid>1].sds, y=df[grid>1].mns, mode=\"lines\", text=100 * df[grid>1].grid, hovertemplate=string, name='CAL (borrowing)', line=dict(color=\"blue\"),\n    )\n    string = \"infeasible saving at borrowing rate<extra></extra>\"\n    trace2 = go.Scatter(\n        x=df[grid<=1].sds, y=df[grid<=1].mns_infeas, mode=\"lines\", hovertemplate=string, showlegend = False, line=dict(color=\"black\", dash='dot'),\n    )\n    string = \"infeasible borrowing at saving rate<extra></extra>\"\n    trace2a = go.Scatter(\n        x=df[grid>1].sds, y=df[grid>1].mns_infeas, mode=\"lines\", hovertemplate=string, showlegend = False, line=dict(color=\"black\", dash='dot'),\n    )\n    string = \"wealth in market = 100%<extra></extra>\"\n    trace3 = go.Scatter(\n        x=[sd], y=[mn], mode=\"markers\", hovertemplate=string, marker=dict(size=15), name='Market'\n    )\n    string = \"wealth in market = 0%<extra></extra>\"\n    trace4 = go.Scatter(\n        x=[0], y=[s], mode=\"markers\", hovertemplate=string, marker=dict(size=15), name='Risk-free (Saving)'\n    )  \n    string = \"Borrowing rate<extra></extra>\"\n    trace5 = go.Scatter(\n        x=[0], y=[b], mode=\"markers\", hovertemplate=string, marker=dict(size=15), name='Risk-free (Borrowing)'\n    )       \n    fig = go.Figure()\n    fig.add_trace(trace1)\n    fig.add_trace(trace1a)\n    fig.add_trace(trace2)\n    fig.add_trace(trace2a)\n    fig.add_trace(trace3)\n    fig.add_trace(trace4)\n    fig.add_trace(trace5)\n    fig.layout.xaxis[\"title\"] = \"Standard Deviation\"\n    fig.layout.yaxis[\"title\"] = \"Expected Return\"\n    fig.update_yaxes(tickformat=\".0%\")\n    fig.update_xaxes(tickformat=\".0%\")\n    fig.update_layout(legend=dict(yanchor=\"top\", y =0.99, xanchor=\"left\", x=0.01))\n    fig.show()\nfigtbl(mn, sd, s, extra)\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 4.1: Capital Allocation Line\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimal Portfolios\nUnder the more realistic assumption that \\(r_f^{\\text{borrow}}>r_f^{\\text{saving}}\\), efficient portfolios fall into three regions, separated by blue dots in Figure 4.2.1 These blue dots indicate an efficient low risk portfolio and an efficient high mean portfolio, both comprised solely of risky assets. The efficient low risk portfolio is the tangency portfolio calculated using the savings rate, and the efficient high mean portfolio is the portfolio maximizing the Sharpe ratio with respect to the borrowing rate.\nTo the left of the efficient low risk portfolio, the efficient portfolios are scaled-down versions of the efficient low risk portfolio with some savings. To the right of the efficient high mean portfolio, the efficient portfolios are scaled-up versions of the efficient high mean portfolio with some borrowing. Both cases are shown as blue lines in the figure. The third region is the portion of the efficient frontier between the efficient low risk and efficient high mean portfolios.

The answer depends on the investor’s risk aversion and the Sharpe ratios of the efficient low risk and high mean portfolios. First, consider investors risk aversion greater than the Sharpe ratio of the efficient low risk portfolio, calculated with respect to the savings rate.2 These high risk aversion investors invest a fraction \\(w^*\\) of their wealth in the efficient low risk portfolio and the remainder is saved as the savings rate. The optimal fraction of wealth in the efficient low risk portfolio as a function of risk aversion is: \\[ w^*_{\\text{low}} = \\frac{E[r_{\\text{low}}-r_f^{\\text{saving}}]}{A \\cdot \\text{var}_{\\text{low}}}.\\]\nSecond, consider investors with risk aversion less than the Sharpe ratio of the efficient high mean portfolio, calculated with respect to the borrowing rate.3 These low risk aversion investors borrow money and hold a levered position in the efficient high mean portfolio. The optimal weight in the efficient high mean portfolio is: \\[ w^*_{\\text{high}} = \\frac{E[r_{\\text{high}}-r_f^{\\text{borrow}}]}{A \\cdot \\text{var}_{\\text{high}}}.\\]\nThe third group of investors are those with intermediate risk aversion (i.e., risk aversion falling between the savings rate efficient low risk Sharpe ratio and the borrowing rate efficient high mean Sharpe ratio). These investors hold a portfolio that is a combination of the efficient low risk and high mean portfolios. They do not borrow or save. The optimal weight in the low-risk portfolio is: \\[ a^* = \\frac{E[r_{\\text{low}} - r_{\\text{high}}] - A (\\text{cov}[r_{\\text{low}}, r_{\\text{high}}]-\\text{var}[r_{\\text{high}}])}{A (\\text{var}[r_{\\text{low}}]+\\text{var}[r_{\\text{high}}]-2\\text{cov}[r_{\\text{low}}, r_{\\text{high}}])}\\,, \\tag{4.1}\\] and \\(1-a^*\\) is the efficient high mean portfolio weight.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeriving \\(a^*\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor intermediate risk aversion levels, the optimal weight in the efficient low-risk portfolio solves \\[ \\underset{a}\\max E[a\\cdot r_{\\text{low}} + (1-a)\\cdot r_{\\text{high}}] - 0.5\\cdot A \\cdot \\text{var}[a\\cdot r_{\\text{low}} + (1-a)\\cdot r_{\\text{high}}]\\,. \\] Equation 4.1 is found by taking the derivative of the mean-variance utility with respect to \\(a\\) and solving the first-order condition for \\(a\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3 shows indifference curves at the highest possible utility level for investors with the indicated risk aversions. The portfolio where each indifference curve intersects the efficient frontier is that investor’s optimal portfolio.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\nmn_stock = 6\nmn_bond  = 3.5\nsd_stock = 15\nsd_bond  = 3.5\ncorr = -5\n\nrs = 2\nextra = 1.25\n\nraver1 = 2\nraver2 = 5\n\ndef data(mn1, mn2, sd1, sd2, c, rs, extra):\n    c = c / 100\n    rb = rs + extra   \n    rs = rs/100\n    rb = rb/100\n    mns = [mn1, mn2]\n    sds = [sd1, sd2]\n    grid = np.linspace(0, 1, 101)\n    ports = [np.array([w, 1 -

Investors with very low levels of risk aversion will hold levered portfolios in the efficient high mean portfolio, and investors with very high levels of risk aversion will hold save some capital at the risk-free rate and the remainder in the efficient low risk portfolio. Investors with intermediate risk aversion will invest 100% of their capital in risky assets, but at different locations along the risky-asset efficient frontier (see hover data in Figure 4.4). These portfolios can be written as a combination of the efficient low risk portfolio and the efficient high mean portfolio (Equation 4.1). A larger fraction is invested in the efficient high mean portfolio with lower risk aversion.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\nmn_stock = 6\nmn_bond  = 3.5\nsd_stock = 15\nsd_bond  = 3.5\ncorr = -5\n\nrs = 2\nextra = 1.25\n\nraver1 = 2\nraver2 = 5\n\ndef data(mn1, mn2, sd1, sd2, c, rs, extra):\n    c = c / 100\n    rb = rs + extra   \n    rs = rs/100\n    rb = rb/100\n    mns = [mn1, mn2]\n    sds = [sd1, sd2]\n    grid = np.linspace(-0.2, 1, 201)\n    ports = [np.array([w, 1 - w]) for w in grid]\n    means = [p.T @ np.array(mns) for p in ports]\n    df = pd.DataFrame(means)\n    df.columns = [\"mean\"]\n    cov = np.array(\n        [[sds[0] ** 2, sds[0] * sds[1] * c], [sds[0] * sds[1] * c, sds[1] ** 2]]\n    ).reshape(2, 2)\n    df[\"stdev\"] = [np.sqrt(p.T @ cov @ p) for p in ports]\n    df[\"wt1\"] = grid\n    df[\"wt2\"] = 1 - df.wt1\n    for col in [\"mean\", \"stdev\"]:\n        df[col] = df[col] / 100\n    df[\"sr_s\"]= (df[\"mean\"] - rs)/df[\"stdev\"]\n    df[\"sr_b\"]= (df[\"mean\"] - rb)/df[\"stdev\"]\n   \n    return df\n\ndef rf_plus_risky(mn, sd, rs, rb, w_min, w_max):\n    mn /= 100\n    sd /= 100\n    rs /= 100\n    rb /= 100\n    grid = np.linspace(w_min, w_max, 201)\n    mns = [(rs + w * (mn - rs) if w <= 1 else rb + w * (mn - rb)) for w in grid]\n    sds = [w * sd for w in grid]\n    srs = (mn - rs)/sd\n    srb = (mn - rb)/sd\n    return grid, mns, sds, srs, srb\n\ndef opt_utility(mns, cov, Shorts, s, b, A):\n    #

    "text": "4.2 Short-Sales Constraints\n\nShort-Sales and Hedging\nIn Chapter 2, we assumed that short-selling is allowed. Short-selling of some assets may sometimes improve mean-variance efficiency. In particular, short-selling a security that is positively correlated with another holding can hedge price movements in the long asset position.\nFigure 4.5 shows how the GMV portfolio and frontier changes if short-sales are not allowed for any of the three equity portfolios. Notice that the global minimum variance portfolio with short-selling involves shorting emerging market equity and invests the proceeds and initial capital in a combination of US and developed international equities.

These portfolios entail shorting the emerging market fund or the US equity fund, respectively.\nWithin the set of expected returns possible without shorting, lower risk portfolios are possible with shorting for expected returns close to the US market fund’s expected return and close to the emerging market fund’s expected return. For the former case, the emerging market fund is shorted and serves as a hedge against long positions in the other two funds. For the latter case, the US equity fund serves as a hedge.\nThe improvement in mean-variance efficiency is sometimes more dramatic than the example above. For instance, Figure 4.6 shows the frontiers for portfolios of 48 industries when shorts sales are or are not allowed. In this case, allowing short sales shifts the frontier leftward for the full range of expected returns obtainable with long-only portfolios of industries.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom pandas_datareader import DataReader as pdr\nfrom cvxopt import matrix\nfrom cvxopt.solvers import qp as Solver, options as SolverOptions\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\nSolverOptions[\"show_progress\"] = False\n# Read data and clean-up missing data (coded -99.99)\nff48 = pdr(\"48_Industry_Portfolios\", \"famafrench\", start=1900)[0]\n\n# Clean-up missings\nfor c in ff48.columns:\n    ff48[c] = np.where(ff48[c]==-99.99, np.nan, ff48[c])\nff48 = ff48/100\n\n# Estimate inputs from historical data\nmns = ff48.mean()\nsds = ff48.std()\nC = ff48.corr()\ncov = np.diag(sds) @ C @ np.diag(sds)\n\n# Frontier with shorting              \nss  = portfolio(mns.values,cov.values, Shorts = True)\nfrontier_ss  = [ss.frontier(m) for m in np.linspace(mns.min(), mns.max(),50)]\nmu_ss = [wgt @ mns for wgt in frontier_ss]\nsd_ss = [np.sqrt(wgt @ cov @ wgt) for wgt in frontier_ss]\n\n# Frontier without shorting\nnoss= portfolio(mns.values,cov.values, Shorts = False)\nfrontier_noss= [noss.frontier(m) for m in np.linspace(mns.min(), mns.max(),50)]\nmu_noss = [wgt @ mns for wgt in frontier_noss]\nsd_noss = [np.sqrt(wgt @ cov @ wgt) for wgt in frontier_noss]\n\n# Plot the frontiers\nstring =  \"Frontier with shorting allowed<br>\"\nstring += \"Expected Return (monthly): %{y:.2%}<br>\"\nstring += \"Standard Deviation (monthly): %{x:.2%}<br>\"\nstring += \"<extra></extra>\"\ntrace_ss  = go.Scatter(x=sd_ss, y=mu_ss, mode=\"lines\", name='With shorting', hovertemplate=string)\nstring =  \"Frontier with no short selling <br>\"\nstring += \"Expected Return (monthly): %{y:.2%}<br>\"\nstring += \"Standard Deviation (monthly): %{x:.2%}<br>\"\nstring += \"<extra></extra>\"\ntrace_noss= go.Scatter(x=sd_noss, y=mu_noss, mode=\"lines\", name='Without shorting', hovertemplate=string)\nfig = go.Figure()\nfig.add_trace(trace_ss)\nfig.add_trace(trace_noss)\nfig.update_layout(legend=dict(yanchor=\"top\", y =0.99, xanchor=\"left\", x=0.01))\nfig.update_yaxes(title=\"Expected Return (monthly)\", tickformat=\".2%\", range=[0.5*np.min(mu_noss+mu_ss), 1.05*np.max(mu_noss+mu_ss)])\nfig.update_xaxes(title=\"Standard Deviation (monthly)\", tickformat=\".2%\", range=[0.5*np.min(sd_noss+sd_ss), 1.05*np.max(sd_noss+sd_ss)])\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 4.6: Industry Portfolio Frontiers with and without Short-Selling\n\n\n\n\n\nGMV and Frontier Portfolios\nShort-sale constraints are an set of additional constraints to the optimization problems for the GMV portfolio and frontier portfolios considered in Equation 2.12 and Equation 3.3.\nWith short-sale constraints, the GMV portfolio is the set of non-negative portfolio weights that minimizes portfolio variance: \\[ \\underset{w_1,w_2,\\dots,w_N}{\\text{min}} \\text{var}[r_p]\\] subject to the constraints \\(\\sum_i w_i=1\\) and \\(w_i \\ge 0\\) for all assets \\(i\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGMV with Short-Sale Constraints\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimizing variance is a quadratic programming problem that can be solved numerically using constrained optimization in Python using the CVXOPT package. The CVXOPT user guide is available  here .\nThe function cvxopt.solvers.qp solves problems of the general form: \\[\\begin{align}\n    \\underset{w}{\\text{min  }}& \\frac{1}{2} w' Q w + p'x \\\\\n     \\text{subject to  } & Gw \\le h \\\\\n                        & Aw = b \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe optimizer is solving for a \\(N \\times 1\\) vector of portfolio weights, \\(w\\) that minimizes the objective function. To minimize variance, we set \\(Q\\) equal to the \\(N \\times N\\) covariance matrix of returns and \\(p\\) equal to a \\(N \\times 1\\) vector of zeros.\nThe constraint \\(Gw \\le h\\) is used to put position limits on the portfolio weights. Short-selling constraints are the most common such constraint. These are accomplished by setting \\(G\\) equal to the negative of the \\(N \\times N\\) identity matrix (that is, a matrix with -1s on the diagonal and zero elsewhere), and \\(h\\) equal to a \\(N \\times 1\\) vector of zeros. Additional position limits could be enforced by adding rows to \\(G\\) and \\(h\\). For instance, many funds have maximum position limits in addition to short-sale constraints.\nThe constraint \\(Aw=b\\) usually includes the constraint that the portfolio is fulling invested; that is, the portfolio weights sum to 100%. This is accomplished by setting \\(A\\) equal to a \\(N \\times 1\\) vector of ones and setting \\(b=1\\). \\(A\\) and \\(b\\) can include additional rows for other constraints. For instance, setting a target expected return is accomplished by adding a row to \\(A\\) with the asset mean vector and adding a row to \\(b\\) with the target expected return. This is done when solving for a particular point on the mean-variance frontier.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom cvxopt import matrix\nfrom cvxopt.solvers import qp as Solver, options as SolverOptions\n\n##### Inputs\n# Risk-free rate\nr = 0.02\n# Expected returns\nmns = np.array([0.06, 0.065, 0.08])\n# Standard deviations\nsds = np.array([0.15, 0.165, 0.21])\n# Correlations\ncorr12 = 0.75\ncorr13 = 0.75\ncorr23 = 0.75\n# Covariance matrix\nC  = np.identity(3)\nC[0, 1] = C[1, 0] = corr12\nC[0, 2] = C[2, 0] = corr13\nC[1, 2] = C[2, 1] = corr23\ncov = np.diag(sds) @ C @ np.diag(sds)\n\n##### GMV problem with short-sale constraints\nn = len(mns)\nQ = matrix(cov, tc=\"d\")\np = matrix(np.zeros(n), (n, 1), tc=\"d\")\n# Constraint: short-sales not allowed\nG = matrix(-np.identity(n), tc=\"d\")\nh = matrix(np.zeros(n), (n, 1), tc=\"d\")\n# Constraint: fully-invested portfolio\nA = matrix(np.ones(n), (1, n), tc=\"d\")\nb = matrix([1], (1, 1), tc=\"d\")\nsol = Solver(Q, p, G, h, A, b)\nwgts_gmv = np.array(sol[\"x\"]).flatten() if sol[\"status\"] == \"optimal\" else np.array(n * [np.nan])\nNote that the GMV without short-sale constraints can be found using numerical optimization by removing the short-sale constraint:\nG = matrix(np.zeros((n,n)), tc=\"d\")\n\n\n\nSimilarly, a frontier portfolio with expected return \\(\\mu_{\\text{target}}\\) is defined by the non-negative portfolio weights that solve the following constrained optimization problem: \\[ \\underset{w_1,w_2,\\dots,w_N}{\\text{min}} \\text{var}[r_p]\\] subject to constraints: \\(\\sum_i w_i E[r_i]=E[r_{\\text{target}}]\\), \\(\\sum_i w_i=1\\) and \\(w_i \\ge 0\\) for all assets \\(i\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontier with Short-Sale Constraints\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative to the GMV problem, the frontier problem contains an additional constraint of the form \\(Aw=b\\) in addition to the usual constraint that the portfolio is fulling invested.

    "text": "A zero-coupon bond is a bond which doesn’t pay any coupon. It is issued at a discount and the investor gets the face value (par value) back at expiration date. Spot rate is the discount rate which makes the present value of a zero-coupon bond equal to its current market price. Consider Treasury Bills which are zero-coupon bonds. The prices of the Treasury zero-coupon bonds tell us the present values of future risk-free dollars.\nWe will use semi-annual compounding for most of this chapter as in the US both Treasury bonds and corporate bonds pay semi annual coupons. Let N be number of semi-annual periods, \\(Q_{N}\\) is the price of a zero-coupon bond with N semi-annual periods to maturity, \\(r_{N}\\) is the N period spot rate.\nThen we have: \\[ Q_{N}= \\frac{100}{(1+\\frac{r_{N}}{2})^N}  \\]\n\\(r_{N}\\) is the rate at which we should be using to discount cashflows from period N. If we know a collection of spot rate \\(r_{1}\\), \\(r_{2}\\)…\\(r_{N}\\), then we can price a bond with any cashflows by discounting each cashflow with the corresponding spot rate. Treasury Bills have maturities less than one year. Although STRIPS (Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities) are in fact Treasury zero coupon bonds, due to their low liqudity level, practitioners seldom infer spot rates from STRIPS. Instead, practitioners construct their own spot rate curve based on Treasury coupon bonds prices.\nSuppose we have a two year Treasury coupon bond with 4% coupon rate. With semi-annual coupon payment, the cash flow from this bond will be: 2, 2, 2, and 102. The theoretical price of this bond can be computed by discounting each future cash flow using corresponding spot rates.\n\\[ P= \\frac{2}{(1+\\frac{r_{1}}{2})^1}+\\frac{2}{(1+\\frac{r_{2}}{2})^2}+\\frac{2}{(1+\\frac{r_{3}}{2})^3}+\\frac{102}{(1+\\frac{r_{4}}{2})^4}  \\]"
