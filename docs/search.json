    "text": "If an investment account earns a steady rate of return and funds are not withdrawn from the account, then the account balance will grow exponentially. This is sometimes called the “miracle of compound interest.” Figure 1.1 shows the growth of an investment account earning 8% per year, which is what the U.S. stock market earned in real terms over the thirty year period 1992-2021. Each dollar grows to roughly $10 over a 30 year period at an 8% annual return. The exponential nature of the growth can be seen from the figure. Hover your cursor over the plot to see the exact values.\nInvestments grow exponentially because they earn returns each year not just on the starting balance but also on all prior returns. Exponential growth is much better than linear growth. By “linear growth,” we mean that doubling the investment period would double the account growth. Exponential is much better than that. As can be seen from the figure, $1 would grow to slightly more than $3 in 15 years at 8% per year, so the growth in value is slightly more than $2. Doubling the investment horizon to 30 years increases the growth to $9 (from $1 to $10), so the growth in value is more than four times larger when the horizon doubles, with an 8% return. Because of exponential growth, it is incredibly important to invest early and to refrain from borrowing whenever possible (unless the borrowing finances the purchase of long-term assets).\nExponential growth also means that the rate of return one earns is extremely important. For example, one might think that earning 8% is twice as good as earning 4%, but that is an understatement. Over a 30 year period, earning 8% is more than four times as good as earning 4%—a dollar grows by $9 to $10 over 30 years at 8%, but it grows by less than $2.25 at 4%.\nThe values in Figure 1.1 are calculated from the following logic. $1 invested for 1 year at 8% grows to $1.08. After another year at 8%, we have \\[\\begin{align*}\n1.08 + (1.08 \\times 0.08) &= (1.08 \\times 1) + (1.08 \\times 0.08)\\\\ &  = 1.08 \\times 1.08 \\\\ &= 1.08^2\n\\end{align*}\\] Continuing with this logic, we can see that after \\(n\\) years, we have \\(1.08^n\\). Thus, the number of years is the exponent of the factor 1.08, which is the definition of exponential growth.\nAs remarked above, the exponential growth is due to earning returns on top of returns or “interest on interest.” After two years at 8%, we have \\[1.08^2 = 1 + 0.08 + 0.08 + (0.08\\times 0.08).\\]\nLinear growth would be just adding up the returns \\(0.08 + 0.08\\). Exponential growth is due to the “interest on interest” term \\(0.08 \\times 0.08.\\) This is a small number when there are only two years, but these terms add up to a very large number over many years. They are responsible for the growth in the investment account quadrupling (from $2.17 to $9.06) when the investment horizon is doubled (from 15 to 30 years) with 8% returns."

Because the relation \\(y=x(1+r)^n\\) is equivalent to \\[x = \\frac{y}{(1+r)^n},\\] we can also compute the present value \\(x\\) from the future value \\(y\\) by dividing by \\((1+r)^n\\) or, equivalently, by multiplying by \\(1/(1+r)^n\\). Consequently, we call \\(1/(1+r)^n\\) the present value factor (or discount factor). The operation of multiplying by the present value factor is called discounting, and the operation of multiplying by the future value factor is called compounding. We also call the rate of return \\(r\\) the discount rate.\nThe values in Figure 1.1 are future value factors at 4% and 8%, for various \\(n\\).

    "text": "1.2 Multiple cash flows\nSuppose we have some money \\(x_0\\) to invest today, will have a possibly different amount \\(x_1\\) to invest in one year, an amount \\(x_2\\) to invest two years from now and so on for \\(m\\) years, and we have an investment horizon of \\(n\\ge m\\) years. How much will we have in \\(n\\) years if we earn a return \\(r\\) each year? In other words, what is the total future value of the sequence of investments \\(x_0, \\ldots, x_m\\)?\nWe can answer this question by treating our investment account as \\(m+1\\) hypothetical separate accounts. In the first account, we deposit \\(x_0\\) today and it grows for \\(n\\) years to \\(x_0(1+r)^n\\). In the second account, we deposit \\(x_1\\) in one year and it grows for \\(n-1\\) years to \\(x_1(1+r)^{n-1}\\). We can continue this through year \\(m\\), and at the end of \\(n\\) years, we can hypothetically consolidate the various accounts, producing a total future value of \\[x_0(1+r)^n + x_1(1+r)^{n-1} + x_2(1+r)^{n-2} + \\cdots +\nx_m(1+r)^{n-m}.\\]\nNow, consider the opposite question. Suppose we want to spend some amount \\(y_1\\) in one year, a possibly different amount \\(y_2\\) in two years, and continuing for \\(m\\) years. If we want to finance all of these expenditures from a current investment account, how much do we need to have in the account now, assuming we always earn a return \\(r\\) on the remaining balance? The answer is that we need to have the total present value of the future values \\(y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_m\\); that is, we need \\[\\frac{y_1}{1+r} + \\frac{y_2}{(1+r)^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{y_m}{(1+r)^m}.\\]\nOur examples here involved only positive cash flows, but it is also possible to compute total future values or total present values in this way when some cash flows are positive and some are negative. In this case, the total present value is usually called the net present value, being the present value of the positive cash flows net of the present value of the negative cash flows. Figure 1.3 illustrates net present value calculations.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: The net present value is the sum of the present values of the cash flows.

    "text": "1.3 Perpetuities and annuities\nAn annuity is a level sequence of cash flows that extends for a finite period of time. A perpetuity is a level sequence of cash flows that extends forever. Annuities are encountered frequently, for example, in mortgage or other loan payments. Perpetuities are used when valuing companies. The value of the stock of a company comes from the cash the company pays to shareholders, and there is no definite time at which these cash flows will end, so it is common to model them as perpetual.\nLet’s start with perpetuities. Suppose we want to spend $100 in one year, another $100 in two years, and so on forever. How much do we need to have in an investment account today to finance all of these expenditures, if the account always earns 10% per year? The answer is $1,000, because the 10% return in a year on a $1,000 investment will be $100, which we can spend without depleting our capital. Hence, we can earn and spend $100 per year forever. More generally, the present value of a cash flow of any amount \\(y\\) per year at a rate of return of \\(r\\) per year is \\(y/r\\), because an investment of \\(y/r\\) will earn \\(y/r \\times r = y\\) each year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerpetuities and geometric series\n\n\n\nAn alternative calculation of the present value of a perpetuity is to add up the infinite sequence of discounted cash flows as \\[\\frac{y}{1+r} + \\frac{y}{(1+r)^2} + \\frac{y}{(1+r)^3} + \\cdots\\] This is a geometric series, with each term being smaller than the previous term by a factor of \\(1/(1+r)\\). By a standard formula, the sum is \\[\\frac{y/(1+r)}{1- 1/(1+r)} = \\frac{y}{r}.\\]\n\n\nNow consider an annuity of \\(y\\) per year for \\(n\\) years. The present value is \\[\\frac{y}{1+r} + \\frac{y}{(1+r)^2}  + \\cdots + \\frac{y}{(1+r)^n}\\] This can be calculated in terms of what we call the annuity factor: \\[ \\text{AF} = \\frac{1}{r} \\left(1-\\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}\\right).\\] The present value of the annuity is \\[ y \\times \\text{AF}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeriving the annuity formula\n\n\n\nTo derive the formula for the present value of an annuity, observe that an annuity is the difference of two perpetuities: a perpetuity that starts in a year and another perpetuity that starts in \\(n+1\\) years. So, the present value is the difference of two present values: the present value \\(y/r\\) of the first perpetuity minus the present value of the second perpetuity. The present value of the second perpetuity as of year \\(n\\) (one year before it begins) is \\(y/r\\) and that value discounted to today is \\[\\frac{1}{(1+r)^n} \\times \\frac{y}{r}.\\] Hence, the present value of the annuity is \\[\\frac{y}{r} - \\frac{1}{(1+r)^n} \\times \\frac{y}{r} = \\frac{y}{r} \\left(1-\\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}\\right) = y \\times \\text{AF}.\\]\n\n\nWhen valuing a company, we often model the cash flows to shareholders as being perpetual and growing over time. So, we need a version of the perpetuity formula that can accomodate growing cash flows. The present value of an infinite sequence of cash flows that begins with \\(y\\) in a year and then grows at a constant rate of \\(g\\) per year forever, when the discount rate is \\(r>g\\), is \\(y/(r-g)\\). For example, the present value of getting $100 in one year, \\(1.03 \\times \\text{\\$}100 = \\text{\\$}103\\) in two years, \\((1.03)^2 \\times \\text{\\$}100\\) in three years, continuing forever, when the discount rate is 10% is \\(\\text{\\$}100/(0.10 - 0.03)= \\text{\\$1,428.57}\\). This is the correct amount because the return in one year will be $142.86, from which one can spend $100 and reinvest $42.86, producing an account balance that is 3% higher than at the start. This reinvestment of the extra return can continue forever, resulting in an account that grows perpetually at 3% and which finances cash flows that grow at 3%. We could also compute the present value by computing the infinite sum \\[\\frac{y}{1+r} + \\frac{(1+g)y}{(1+r)^2} + \\frac{(1+g)^2y}{(1+r)^3} + \\cdots\\] using the same formula as in If \\(g \\ge r\\), meaning that growth in the cash flows is so fast that it offsets or more than offsets the discounting, then the terms in this series are constant or rising, so the present value is infinite."

    "section": "1.4 Monthly rates, etc.",
    "text": "1.4 Monthly rates, etc.\nWe frequently encounter rates of return, including interest rates, at frequencies other than a year, for example, when calculating monthly mortgage payments. There are two ways of relating monthly rates to annual rates. One is to compound monthly rates, which includes ‘interest on interest’ as we have discussed before. The other way is to multiply by 12, which would be linear rather than exponential growth.\nFirst we address compounding. If we earn interest or some other return monthly at rate \\(r_m\\), then the rate of return per year is \\((1+r_m)^{12}-1\\). For example, if we earn 1% per month, then in one year, each dollar invested will grow to \\(1.01^{12} = 1.1268\\) dollars, which is a rate of return of 12.68%.\nWe can reverse this calculation to compute a monthly rate given an annual rate \\(r_a\\). The formula for the monthly rate is \\[r_m = (1+r_a)^{1/12} - 1.\\] For example, if we plug in \\(r_a = 0.1268\\), we’ll get \\(r_m = 0.01\\) (up to rounding error).\nThis is a logical way to define monthly rates from annual rates, but it is not the way a bank does it when you take out a loan. If a bank says that the annual rate is 12.68%, then it will charge you \\[\\frac{0.1268}{12} = 0.0106.\\] So, the bank will charge you 1.06% monthly. Obviously, this works in the bank’s favor, relative to the calculation based on compounding.\nReturning to the compounding calculation, we could also compound at frequencies other than a month or a year. If we compound daily at a daily rate of \\(r_d\\), then the corresponding annual rate is \\[r_a = (1+r_d)^{365} - 1.\\] The annual rate achieved by compounding is higher the more frequently a bank compounds. Continuing with our previous example of 12%, with monthly compounding we have \\[r_a = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.12}{12}\\right)^{12} - 1 = 0.1268\\] as observed before, and with daily compounding we have \\[r_a = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.12}{365}\\right)^{365} - 1 = 0.12747.\\] Thus, increasing the compounding frequency increases the corresponding annual rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuously compounded returns\n\n\n\nWe could consider even more frequent compounding. In the limit, as compounding becomes continuous, we can invoke a result from mathematical analysis to obtain \\[\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}  \\left(1 + \\frac{0.12}{n}\\right)^{n} - 1  = e^{0.12} - 1 = 0.12750,\\] where \\(e\\) is the natural exponential \\(2.718\\ldots\\). More generally, continuous compounding at rate \\(z\\) means that $1 grows to \\(e^z\\) dollars in a year. For any return \\(r\\), there is an equivalent continuously compounded return given by \\(\\log (1+r)\\) where \\(\\log\\) denotes the natural logarithm function. To see this, let \\(z=\\log (1+r)\\). With continuous compounding at rate \\(z\\), $1 grows to \\(e^z = e^{\\log (1+r)} = 1+r\\). Thus, continuous compounding at rate \\(\\log (1+r)\\) is the same as earning \\(r\\). Obviously, continuous compounding is never encountered in practice, but it is a useful “as if” device for some calculations."

If the loan has level payments \\(P\\), then the loan principal \\(L\\) satisfies \\[L = P \\times \\text{AF} = \\frac{P}{r}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}\\right)\\,.\\] From this equation, we can calculate any of the loan parameters in terms of the others. Thus, we can answer any of the following questions:\n\n(\\(P\\)) I know how much I want to borrow, what the term of the loan will be, and what the rate will be. What will my payments be?\n(\\(L\\)) I know what the term of the loan will be and what the rate will be, and I know the payment that I can afford. How much can I borrow?\n(\\(r\\)) I know what the term of the loan will be, how much I want to borrow, and how much I can afford to pay. What rate do I need to get?\n\nThese are standard questions, and their answers – which are obtained by solving the above equation – are provided by online financial calculators and by the Excel and numpy-financial functions pmt, pv, and rate. See Section 1.10. For loans with monthly payments, we need to input the number of months as the number of periods and the monthly rate as the rate. For example, for a 30-year mortgage at a rate of 6%, we would input \\(30 \\times 12\\) as the number of periods and \\(0.06/12\\) as the rate.\nSometimes a loan will have a balloon payment, meaning an extra payment at the end to make up for the periodic payments being too small. The amount of any balloon \\(B\\) is determined by the equation \\[L = P \\times \\text{AF} + \\frac{B}{(1+r)^n}\\,.\\] This again reflects the fact that the present value of all payments equals the principal. The amount of a balloon payment can be calculated from the Excel and numpy-financial function fv.\nEach payment on a loan pays the interest that has accrued during the previous period plus something towards principal. As the principal is paid down, the interest decreases, so the payment towards principal increases. Tracking the principal over time is called creating an amortization table. Let’s create such a table. By doing so, we will also see why the present value of the payments equals the principal.\nADD AMORTIZATION TABLE"

    "text": "1.6 Inflation and real returns\nIn the decade 1971–1980, the U.S. stock market returned an average of 9.2% per year. A dollar invested at the first of January in 1971 would have grown to $2.40 by the end of December in 1980. As decades go, this is quite far from the worst for the U.S. stock market.1 However, the 1970’s were a time of high inflation. What was the market performance in real terms? To be more precise, if we had invested $1 at the begining of January, 1971, by how much would our real buying power have grown by the end of December, 1980? In other words, what was our return in constant dollars? We will see here how to answer these questions.\nThe term “inflation rate” means the percent change in a price index. In the U.S., the standard price index used for this calculation is the Consumer Price Index – All Urban calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It represents the cost of a basket of goods sampled in 87 urban areas across the U.S. To have 7% inflation in a year means that the basket of goods costs 7% more at the end of the year than at the beginning, or in other words that \\[\\frac{\\text{CPI at end of year}}{\\text{CPI at beginning of year}} = 1.07.\\]\nConsider an item that costs $100 today. Suppose there is 7% inflation in the coming year, and the item costs $107 at the end of the year. Suppose also that our portfolio earns 10% in the year. To calculate our real return, consider each $100 that we have at the start of the year. Each $100 could buy one item. In a year’s time, the $100 grows to $110, and the item costs $107, so we could buy one and have $3 left over, which would buy 3/107 units. This 3/107 is the growth in our buying power relative to the start of the year, so our real return is 3/107.\nWe can express the calculation in the previous paragraph in more generality as \\[\\text{real return} = \\frac{\\text{nominal return} - \\text{inflation rate}}{1 + \\text{inflation rate}},\\] where the nominal return is the return before adjustment for inflation (10% in our example) and all returns and rates are in decimal form. We also call the real return the return in constant dollars.\nWe can compound real returns the same way we compounded returns earlier. Let \\(r\\) denote the real return, \\(i\\) denote the inflation rate, and \\(z\\) denote the nominal return (all in decimal form). Adding 1 to both sides of the equation for the real return gives \\[1+r = \\frac{z-i}{1+i} + 1 = \\frac{1+z}{1+i}.\\] To calculate what $1 grows to in constant dollars over a period of \\(n\\) years, we calculate \\[(1+r_1)(1+r_2) \\cdots (1+r_n)\\] where the \\(r_i\\) are the real returns. By the above formula, \\[(1+r_1) \\cdots (1+r_n) = \\frac{(1+z_1) \\cdots (1+z_n)}{(1+i_1) \\cdots (1+i_n)}.\\] The numerator on the right hand side is what $1 grows to in nominal dollars. The denominator is the growth in the price index. To be specific, the denominator is \\[\\frac{\\text{CPI at end of year $n$}}{\\text{CPI at beginning of year 1}}.\\] Thus, the real return over a period of years equals the nominal return over the period with the growth in the CPI divided out.\nTo come back to our example – over the decade 1971–1980, $1 invested in the U.S. stock market grew to $2.40 in nominal terms, as stated earlier. However, the CPI at the end of the decade was 2.3 times its value at the beginning of the decade. In other words, compounded inflation \\((1+i_1) \\cdots (1+i_n)\\) over the decade was 2.3. So, the dollar grew to only 2.40 / 2.30 = 1.04 dollars in real terms, meaning that the total real return over the decade was only 4%. So, it was a middling decade in nominal terms and a very poor decade in real terms."

    "text": "1.7 Geometric average returns\nThe actual returns of the U.S. market over the decade 1971–1980 were\n\n1971 = 16.17%\n1972 = 16.89%\n1973 = –19.25%\n1974 = –27.75%\n1975 = 38.24%\n1976 = 26.99%\n1977 = –3.14%\n1978 = 8.21%\n1979 = 23.47%\n1980 = 33.37%\n\nThe average of these ten numbers is 11.32%. So, why did we say in the previous section that the market averaged 9.2% in the decade? The reason is that, if we had been invested throughout the decade, our return would have been exactly the same as if we earned 9.2% each year; that is, \\[(1+r_{\\text{1971}}) \\cdots (1+r_{\\text{1980}}) = 2.40 = 1.092^{10}.\\] However, we should be more precise in our language. The correct thing to say is that the geometric average return in the decade was 9.2%. The general definition of the geometric average of a sequence of returns \\(r_1, \\ldots, r_n\\) is that it is the number \\(r\\) such that \\[(1+r)^n = (1+r_1) \\cdots (1+r_n).\\] In other words, $1 grows to the same amount in an account that earns the returns \\(r_1, \\ldots, r_n\\) as it does when earning \\(r\\) each period. When there is a risk of confusion, we will call the usual average (0.1132 for 1971–1980) the arithmetic average return. Both averages have their uses, as we will see in subsequent chapters.\nIf there is any variability in the returns from period to period, then the geometric average is smaller than the arithmetic average, and the difference between the two is larger when returns are more variable. The substantial variability in the 1970’s produced the more than 2% difference between the two for that decade.\nAn even more extreme example is Tesla (TSLA), which fell by roughly 50% between November 2021 and May 2022 and then gained roughly 50% between May 2022 and August 2022.2 Were Tesla shareholders back to even? No, each $100 of Tesla stock fell to $50 and then gained 50% on $50 to get back only to $75, for an overall 25% loss. The arithmetic average of 0 in this case substantially overstates the actual experience of Tesla shareholders. The geometric average over these two periods is \\(\\sqrt{(1-0.5)(1+0.5)} - 1 = -0.134\\). This reflects the fact that if you lose 13.4% twice in a row, then you have lost 25%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric average and continuously compounded returns\n\n\n\nThe term “geometric average” is not unique to finance, but it is used a little differently in finance than elsewhere. Using the term in its non-finance meaning, the relationship \\[(1+r)^n = (1+r_1) \\cdots (1+r_n)\\] would be described by saying that \\(1+r\\) is the geometric average of the \\(1+r_1, \\ldots, 1+r_n\\). This is a little cumbersome to say, so in finance we simply say that \\(r\\) is the geometric average of the \\(r_i\\). To see in what sense this relationship represents an average, take the natural logarithm of both sides. This produces \\[n \\log (1+r) = \\log (1+r_1) + \\cdots \\log (1+r_n)\\] or, equivalently, \\[\\log (1+r) = \\frac{\\log (1+r_1) + \\cdots + \\log (1+r_n)}{n}.\\] Thus, “geometric average” means “average in logs.” As discussed earlier, these logarithms of one-plus-returns are called continuously compounded returns, so “geometric average” means a normal (arithmetic) average for continuously compounded returns."

Our account will grow during the month due to the investment return \\(rB_0\\) and the deposit, so our balance at the end of the first month will be \\[B_1 = (1+r)B_0 + D_1.\\] The date subscripts correspond to month-ends: \\(B_1\\) is the balance at the end of month 1, etc. The account continues to grow monthly as \\[B_i = (1+r)B_{i-1} + D_i\\] until the date of our last deposit. Call this date \\(m\\), so there are \\(m\\) months of deposits. In other words, we plan to work for \\(m\\) more months and then retire.\nTo finance our spending during the first month of retirement (month \\(m+1\\)), we’ll make a withdrawal at the beginning of the month, which is again date \\(m\\) (beginning of month \\(m+1\\) = end of month \\(m\\)). So, we make both a deposit and a withdrawal at date \\(m\\) (of course, we would really only make the net deposit or withdrawal), producing \\[B_m = (1+r)B_{m-1} + D_m - W_m.\\] Subsequently, we make only withdrawals, so \\[B_i = (1+r)B_{i-1} - W_i\\] until the last month. Call this month \\(n\\), so there are \\(n\\) total months. We make a withdrawal at the beginning of month \\(n\\), which is date \\(n-1\\), producing \\[B_{n-1} = (1+r)B_{n-2} - W_{n-1},\\] and if there is anything remaining in the account at that time it earns a final return in the last month, producing a “bequest” of \\[B_n = (1+r)B_{n-1}.\\]\nWe probably expect our income to grow in real terms during our working years, so let’s assume the deposits grow in real terms at some constant rate \\(g\\). Thus, we need to input \\(D_1\\) and then calculate \\(D_2 = (1+g)D_1\\), \\(D_3 = (1+g)D_2\\), etc. It’s not clear whether where our withdrawals should grow in real terms over time or decline, so let’s assume they are a constant amount \\(W\\). Thus, the inputs are \\(m\\), \\(n\\), \\(r\\), \\(B_0\\), \\(g\\), \\(D_1\\), and \\(W\\). Figure 1.4 presents an example. An interactive figure with user inputs is provided at the BBCX Investments Library.\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 1.4: A retirement account with m=360 month of deposits, n= 720 total months, a monthly rate of return of r= 0.5%, an initial balance of B_0 = $100,000, a monthly deposit growth rate of g=0.1%, an initial deposit of D_1 = $1,000, and monthly withdrawals equal to W = $10,000.\n\n\n\nThe ending balance of the account is the future value of the initial balance plus the future values of the deposits minus the future values of the withdrawals.\nWe probably want to ask:\n\nGiven our current balance, planned deposits, and anticipated rate of return, what withdrawals will we be able to make?\n\nOr:\n\nGiven the withdrawals we plan to make, our current blance, and anticipated rate of return, what deposits do we need to make?\n\nTo answer questions of this type, the “sum of future values” representation is convenient. The future values (of the initial balance, deposits, and withdrawals) are all proportional to inputs (\\(B_0\\), \\(D_1\\), and \\(W\\)), so it is straightforward to solve for those inputs. An interactive page with user inputs that also solves for the growth rate \\(g\\) is provided at the BBCX Investments Library."

For a given portfolio weight in the risky asset \\(w\\), we first need to determine the portfolio’s expected return and standard deviation. Considering all possible risky portfolio weights traces out the set of possible investments, which is called the capital allocation line in expected return/standard deviation space.\nFrom Equation 2.4, the variance of portfolio \\(r_p\\) with non-negative \\(w\\) invested in the risky asset and \\(1-w\\) invested in the risk-free rate is: \\[\\text{var}[r_p]=w^2 \\text{var}[r_{\\text{risky}}]+ (1-w)^2 \\text{var}[r_f]+ 2 w(1-w) \\text{cov}[r_{\\text{risky}},r_f]\\,. \\] Note that the risk-free asset’s return is nonrandom (\\(\\text{var}[r_f]=0\\)) and thus does not covary with the risky asset return (\\(\\text{cov}[r_{\\text{risky}},r_f]=0\\)), so the portfolio variance simplifies to: \\[\\text{var}[r_p]=w^2 \\text{var}[r_{\\text{risky}}]\\,.\\] Thus, the portfolio’s standard deviation is: \\[ \\text{sd}[r_p] = w\\cdot \\text{sd}[r_{\\text{risky}}]\\,. \\tag{3.1}\\]\nThe expected return of the portfolio is: \\[ E[r_p] = w E[r_{\\text{risky}}]+ (1-w) r_f \\,. \\tag{3.2}\\] Solving Equation 3.1 for \\(w\\), substituting into Equation 3.2, and rearranging yields the relationship between expected return and standard deviation along the capital allocation line: \\[ E[r_p] = r_f + \\bigg[ \\frac{E[r_{\\text{risky}}]-r_f}{\\text{sd}[r_{\\text{risky}}] }\\bigg] \\cdot \\text{sd}[r_p] \\,. \\tag{3.3}\\] The capital allocation line for a risky asset is a set of portfolios combining the risky asset with the risk-free asset. In expected return/standard deviation space, the \\(y\\)-intercept is the risk-free rate of return and the slope of the line is the ratio of the expected excess return of the risky asset to its standard deviation. This ratio is called the Sharpe ratio, after Nobel laureate  William Sharpe . We discuss it in more detail below.\nFigure 4.1 shows the set of possible portfolios along the capital allocation line. Portfolios to the left of the market portfolio entail investing a fraction of wealth \\(w\\) in the market and the remainder is saved, earning interest at the risk-free rate. Portfolios to the right of the market portfolio are levered portfolios. These portfolios involve borrowing at the risk-free rate (a negative portfolio weight on the risk-free asset).

    "text": "3.2 The Tangency Portfolio\nWhat if we can invest in multiple risky assets and the risk-free asset? What is the best way to form a portfolio in this case? Let’s assume that in addition to the US stock market fund, we are also considering investing in a long-term bond fund. Empirically, over the last 30 or 40 years, equities and long-term government bonds have been almost uncorrelated; we will use a correlation of -5% below.\nFirst, consider the investment opportunity sets that would obtain if we restricted attention to investing in only a single risky fund (either the stock or bond fund) in conjunction with the risk-free asset. The possible portfolios are the capital allocation lines for the stock fund and the bond fund, respectively. These are plotted as the orange and red lines in Figure 3.2. We can see immediately that all portfolios on the CAL for the stock fund are dominated by both the stock-bond frontier (the black line) and by the bond CAL (the red line). The same expected return can be achieved for smaller standard deviation.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 3.2: Tangency portfolio of two risky assets\n\n\n\nRecall from Equation 3.3 that the slope of the CAL for a risky asset is the Sharpe ratio. The Sharpe ratio is a measure of the excess return of an investment per unit of risk. Since investors like expected returns and dislike risk, they want high Sharpe ratios. Note in Figure 3.2 that the Sharpe ratio of the bond is higher than that of the stock portfolio. The highest possible Sharpe ratio is obtained by combining the risk-free asset with a risky portfolio so that the CAL slope is as high as possible. This occurs when the CAL is tangent to the curve of risky-only portfolios. This portfolio of risky assets is thus called the tangency portfolio. Investing along the CAL of the tangency portfolio offers the highest possible Sharpe ratio, regardless of any desired level of expected return or risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating the Tangency Portfolio\n\n\n\n\n\nIf short sales are allowed, the tangency portfolio weights satisfy a system of equations. The inner product of the tangency portfolio \\(w\\) with each column of the covariance matrix \\(\\text{cov}_i\\) is proportional to the asset’s risk premium \\(E[r_i]-r_f\\) (\\(n-1\\) equations): \\[ \\frac{w'\\text{cov}_i}{w'\\text{cov}_j} = \\frac{E[r_i]-r_f}{E[r_j]-r_f}\\,,\\] and the portfolio is fully invested: \\[\\sum_i w_i = 1.\\]\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n##### Inputs\n# Risk-free rate\nr = 0.02\n# Expected returns\nmns = np.array([0.10, 0.05, 0.07])\n# Standard deviations\nsds = np.array([0.20, 0.12, 0.15])\n# Correlations\ncorr12 = 0.3\ncorr13 = 0.3\ncorr23 = 0.3\n# Covariance matrix\nC  = np.identity(3)\nC[0, 1] = C[1, 0] = corr12\nC[0, 2] = C[2, 0] = corr13\nC[1, 2] = C[2, 1] = corr23\ncov = np.diag(sds) @ C @ np.diag(sds)\n\n##### Tangency Portfolio\nw = np.linalg.solve(cov, mns - r)\nwgts_tangency = w / np.sum(w)\n\n\n\nThe tangency portfolio is thus the optimal combination of risky assets, and all investors should invest somewhere along the tangency portfolio CAL. This is an example of the two-fund separation property of asset allocation. All investors will choose to allocate capital to the risk-free asset and an optimal risky asset portfolio. The problem of determining an optimal all-risky asset portfolio is separate from the choice of where to invest on the resulting capital allocation line. We discuss the latter decision of how much capital to allocate to risky assets relative to the risk-free asset in the rest of this section."

    "text": "3.3 Preferences over Risk and Return\nIn order to make statements about “optimal” portfolios, we need to describe the preferences of investors in some way. A standard way to do so is to use mean-variance utility. Simply put, we will assume that investors like higher expected returns and dislike portfolios with riskier returns. The amount of extra expected return needed for an investor to take on additional risk is governed by the investor’s risk aversion, which we will denote by \\(A\\).\nMathematically, mean-variance utility for a given portfolio return \\(r_p\\) is: \\[ U(r_p)=E[r_p] - 0.5\\cdot A \\cdot \\text{var}[r_p]\\,.\\] The utility of a risky investment is its expected return minus a penalty for variance. More risk averse investors have higher values for \\(A\\), meaning that they put greater penalties on variance. Figure 3.3 shows indifference curves for three different levels of risk aversion, but the same level of utility. When risk aversion is higher, a higher expected return is required to reach the utility for a given level of risk, and the extra expected return increases when risk increases.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 3.3: Indifference curves with different levels of risk aversion\n\n\n\nInvestors are indifferent between portfolios that generate the same utility. Figure 3.4 shows three different levels of utility, holding risk aversion fixed. A utility of, for example, 10% means that the investor would be indifferent between the risky investment and a risk-free investment with a return of 10%. That is, any portfolio located on the green indifference curve in Figure 3.4 provides the same level of utility to this investor. Higher utility is achieved with either a higher expected return or lower risk or both.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 3.4: Indifference curves with same level of risk aversion"

Investors with different risk aversion will choose different combinations of the risky asset and the risk-free asset.\nWhile Equation 3.5 applies to the optimal capital allocation between any risky portfolio and the risk-free asset, the risky portfolio is usually some optimal combination of risky assets like the tangency portfolio. Thus, with multiple risky assets, asset allocation decisions are made in two steps. First, the optimal combination of risky assets, the tangency portfolio, is found. With the same set of inputs for expected returns, standard deviations, and correlations, all investors find the tangency portfolio to be the optimal risky portfolio. Second, investors choose how to allocate capital between the risky portfolio and the risk-free asset. Investors will differ in the fraction of their wealth to invest in the tangency portfolio relative to the risk-free asset because investors with different risk aversions will find different portfolios on the tangency portfolio capital allocation line to be better than others based on their own preferences.\nFigure 3.5 shows the indifference curves at the highest possible utility level for investors with the indicated risk aversions. Investors with lower risk aversion will choose portfolios further up the capital allocation line, accepting greater risk for higher expected returns.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 3.5: Preferences and Efficient Portfolios\n\n\n\nAnother way to see how risk aversion affects capital allocation is to plot the weight in the tangency portfolio as a function of risk aversion, as in Figure 3.6. Higher risk aversion translates into lower holdings of the tangency portfolio. For the assumed inputs, investors with risk aversions below about 15 would choose a levered position in the tangency portfolio. That is, they would find it optimal to borrow money and invest it and their initial investment wealth in the tangency portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 3.6: Preferences and Efficient Portfolios"

In Chapter 3, we assumed a single risk-free rate. Any portfolios with \\(w>100\\%\\) involve borrowing at the risk-free rate (that is, issuing bonds at the same rate as, say, US Treasuries). This is probably not a reasonable assumption. For most investors, \\(r^{\\text{borrow}}>r^{\\text{saving}}\\). In this case, the capital allocation line is kinked at the risky-asset. For portfolios with some risk-free saving, the capital allocation line is the same as in Equation 3.3:\n\\[ E[r_p] = r_f^{\\text{saving}} + \\bigg[ \\frac{E[r_{\\text{risky}}]-r_f^{\\text{saving}}}{\\text{sd}[r_{\\text{risky}}] }\\bigg]\\cdot \\text{sd}[r_p]\\,.\\]\nFor portfolios with borrowing, the capital allocation line has a lower slope: \\[ E[r_p] = r_f^{\\text{borrow}} + \\bigg[ \\frac{E[r_{\\text{risky}}]-r_f^{\\text{borrow}}}{\\text{sd}[r_{\\text{risky}}] }\\bigg]\\cdot \\text{sd}[r_p]\\,.\\] Figure 4.1 shows the set of possible portfolios along the kinked capital allocation line with differential savings and borrowing rates. The black dotted lines extend the blue solid lines, but the points on the black dotted lines are infeasible, because they involve saving at the borrowing rate or borrowing at the savings rate.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 4.1: Capital Allocation Line\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimal Portfolios\nUnder the more realistic assumption that \\(r_f^{\\text{borrow}}>r_f^{\\text{saving}}\\), efficient portfolios fall into three regions, separated by blue dots in Figure 4.2.1 These blue dots indicate an efficient low risk portfolio and an efficient high mean portfolio, both comprised solely of risky assets. The efficient low risk portfolio is the tangency portfolio calculated using the savings rate, and the efficient high mean portfolio is the portfolio maximizing the Sharpe ratio with respect to the borrowing rate.\nTo the left of the efficient low risk portfolio, the efficient portfolios are scaled-down versions of the efficient low risk portfolio with some savings. To the right of the efficient high mean portfolio, the efficient portfolios are scaled-up versions of the efficient high mean portfolio with some borrowing. Both cases are shown as blue lines in the figure. The third region is the portion of the efficient frontier between the efficient low risk and efficient high mean portfolios. These portfolios do not involve saving or borrowing. Investors with different preferences will choose to invest in different locations across these three regions, as discussed in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 4.2: Portfolios of two risky assets and risk-free saving and borrowing\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimal Capital Allocation\nWhere do investors with different risk aversions choose to invest when faced with this investment opportunity set? The answer depends on the investor’s risk aversion and the Sharpe ratios of the efficient low risk and high mean portfolios. First, consider investors risk aversion greater than the Sharpe ratio of the efficient low risk portfolio, calculated with respect to the savings rate.2 These high risk aversion investors invest a fraction \\(w^*\\) of their wealth in the efficient low risk portfolio and the remainder is saved as the savings rate. The optimal fraction of wealth in the efficient low risk portfolio as a function of risk aversion is: \\[ w^*_{\\text{low}} = \\frac{E[r_{\\text{low}}-r_f^{\\text{saving}}]}{A \\cdot \\text{var}_{\\text{low}}}.\\]\nSecond, consider investors with risk aversion less than the Sharpe ratio of the efficient high mean portfolio, calculated with respect to the borrowing rate.3 These low risk aversion investors borrow money and hold a levered position in the efficient high mean portfolio. The optimal weight in the efficient high mean portfolio is: \\[ w^*_{\\text{high}} = \\frac{E[r_{\\text{high}}-r_f^{\\text{borrow}}]}{A \\cdot \\text{var}_{\\text{high}}}.\\]\nThe third group of investors are those with intermediate risk aversion (i.e., risk aversion falling between the savings rate efficient low risk Sharpe ratio and the borrowing rate efficient high mean Sharpe ratio). These investors hold a portfolio that is a combination of the efficient low risk and high mean portfolios. They do not borrow or save. The optimal weight in the low-risk portfolio is: \\[ a^* = \\frac{E[r_{\\text{low}} - r_{\\text{high}}] - A (\\text{cov}[r_{\\text{low}}, r_{\\text{high}}]-\\text{var}[r_{\\text{high}}])}{A (\\text{var}[r_{\\text{low}}]+\\text{var}[r_{\\text{high}}]-2\\text{cov}[r_{\\text{low}}, r_{\\text{high}}])}\\,, \\tag{4.1}\\] and \\(1-a^*\\) is the efficient high mean portfolio weight.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeriving \\(a^*\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor intermediate risk aversion levels, the optimal weight in the efficient low-risk portfolio solves \\[ \\underset{a}\\max E[a\\cdot r_{\\text{low}} + (1-a)\\cdot r_{\\text{high}}] - 0.5\\cdot A \\cdot \\text{var}[a\\cdot r_{\\text{low}} + (1-a)\\cdot r_{\\text{high}}]\\,. \\] Equation 4.1 is found by taking the derivative of the mean-variance utility with respect to \\(a\\) and solving the first-order condition for \\(a\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3 shows indifference curves at the highest possible utility level for investors with the indicated risk aversions. The portfolio where each indifference curve intersects the efficient frontier is that investor’s optimal portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 4.3: Preferences and Efficient Portfolios\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4 plots the allocation to risky assets as a function of risk aversion. Investors with very low levels of risk aversion will hold levered portfolios in the efficient high mean portfolio, and investors with very high levels of risk aversion will hold save some capital at the risk-free rate and the remainder in the efficient low risk portfolio. Investors with intermediate risk aversion will invest 100% of their capital in risky assets, but at different locations along the risky-asset efficient frontier (see hover data in Figure 4.4). These portfolios can be written as a combination of the efficient low risk portfolio and the efficient high mean portfolio (Equation 4.1). A larger fraction is invested in the efficient high mean portfolio with lower risk aversion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 4.4: Preferences and Efficient Portfolios"

    "text": "4.2 Short-Sales Constraints\n\nShort-Sales and Hedging\nIn Chapter 2, we assumed that short-selling is allowed. Short-selling of some assets may sometimes improve mean-variance efficiency. In particular, short-selling a security that is positively correlated with another holding can hedge price movements in the long asset position.\nFigure 4.5 shows how the GMV portfolio and frontier changes if short-sales are not allowed for any of the three equity portfolios. Notice that the global minimum variance portfolio with short-selling involves shorting emerging market equity and invests the proceeds and initial capital in a combination of US and developed international equities. Without this possibility, the GMV portfolio without short-sales has a higher standard deviation (and invests nothing in the emerging market portfolio).\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 4.5: Short-Selling and the Frontier\n\n\n\nThe frontier with short-selling coincides with the frontier without short-selling for many expected return values, but shorting allows an investor to reach expected returns values below the minimum expected returns of the assets (the US equity portfolio) and above the maximum expected return of the underlying assets (the emerging market portfolio). These portfolios entail shorting the emerging market fund or the US equity fund, respectively.\nWithin the set of expected returns possible without shorting, lower risk portfolios are possible with shorting for expected returns close to the US market fund’s expected return and close to the emerging market fund’s expected return. For the former case, the emerging market fund is shorted and serves as a hedge against long positions in the other two funds. For the latter case, the US equity fund serves as a hedge.\nThe improvement in mean-variance efficiency is sometimes more dramatic than the example above. For instance, Figure 4.6 shows the frontiers for portfolios of 48 industries when shorts sales are or are not allowed. In this case, allowing short sales shifts the frontier leftward for the full range of expected returns obtainable with long-only portfolios of industries.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 4.6: Industry Portfolio Frontiers with and without Short-Selling\n\n\n\n\n\nGMV and Frontier Portfolios\nShort-sale constraints are an set of additional constraints to the optimization problems for the GMV portfolio and frontier portfolios considered in Equation 2.12 and Equation 3.3.\nWith short-sale constraints, the GMV portfolio is the set of non-negative portfolio weights that minimizes portfolio variance: \\[ \\underset{w_1,w_2,\\dots,w_N}{\\text{min}} \\text{var}[r_p]\\] subject to the constraints \\(\\sum_i w_i=1\\) and \\(w_i \\ge 0\\) for all assets \\(i\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGMV with Short-Sale Constraints\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimizing variance is a quadratic programming problem that can be solved numerically using constrained optimization in Python using the CVXOPT package. The CVXOPT user guide is available  here .\nThe function cvxopt.solvers.qp solves problems of the general form: \\[\\begin{align}\n    \\underset{w}{\\text{min  }}& \\frac{1}{2} w' Q w + p'x \\\\\n     \\text{subject to  } & Gw \\le h \\\\\n                        & Aw = b \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe optimizer is solving for a \\(N \\times 1\\) vector of portfolio weights, \\(w\\) that minimizes the objective function. To minimize variance, we set \\(Q\\) equal to the \\(N \\times N\\) covariance matrix of returns and \\(p\\) equal to a \\(N \\times 1\\) vector of zeros.\nThe constraint \\(Gw \\le h\\) is used to put position limits on the portfolio weights. Short-selling constraints are the most common such constraint. These are accomplished by setting \\(G\\) equal to the negative of the \\(N \\times N\\) identity matrix (that is, a matrix with -1s on the diagonal and zero elsewhere), and \\(h\\) equal to a \\(N \\times 1\\) vector of zeros. Additional position limits could be enforced by adding rows to \\(G\\) and \\(h\\). For instance, many funds have maximum position limits in addition to short-sale constraints.\nThe constraint \\(Aw=b\\) usually includes the constraint that the portfolio is fulling invested; that is, the portfolio weights sum to 100%. This is accomplished by setting \\(A\\) equal to a \\(N \\times 1\\) vector of ones and setting \\(b=1\\). \\(A\\) and \\(b\\) can include additional rows for other constraints. For instance, setting a target expected return is accomplished by adding a row to \\(A\\) with the asset mean vector and adding a row to \\(b\\) with the target expected return. This is done when solving for a particular point on the mean-variance frontier.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom cvxopt import matrix\nfrom cvxopt.solvers import qp as Solver, options as SolverOptions\n\n##### Inputs\n# Risk-free rate\nr = 0.02\n# Expected returns\nmns = np.array([0.06, 0.065, 0.08])\n# Standard deviations\nsds = np.array([0.15, 0.165, 0.21])\n# Correlations\ncorr12 = 0.75\ncorr13 = 0.75\ncorr23 = 0.75\n# Covariance matrix\nC  = np.identity(3)\nC[0, 1] = C[1, 0] = corr12\nC[0, 2] = C[2, 0] = corr13\nC[1, 2] = C[2, 1] = corr23\ncov = np.diag(sds) @ C @ np.diag(sds)\n\n##### GMV problem with short-sale constraints\nn = len(mns)\nQ = matrix(cov, tc=\"d\")\np = matrix(np.zeros(n), (n, 1), tc=\"d\")\n# Constraint: short-sales not allowed\nG = matrix(-np.identity(n), tc=\"d\")\nh = matrix(np.zeros(n), (n, 1), tc=\"d\")\n# Constraint: fully-invested portfolio\nA = matrix(np.ones(n), (1, n), tc=\"d\")\nb = matrix([1], (1, 1), tc=\"d\")\nsol = Solver(Q, p, G, h, A, b)\nwgts_gmv = np.array(sol[\"x\"]).flatten() if sol[\"status\"] == \"optimal\" else np.array(n * [np.nan])\nNote that the GMV without short-sale constraints can be found using numerical optimization by removing the short-sale constraint:\nG = matrix(np.zeros((n,n)), tc=\"d\")\n\n\n\nSimilarly, a frontier portfolio with expected return \\(\\mu_{\\text{target}}\\) is defined by the non-negative portfolio weights that solve the following constrained optimization problem: \\[ \\underset{w_1,w_2,\\dots,w_N}{\\text{min}} \\text{var}[r_p]\\] subject to constraints: \\(\\sum_i w_i E[r_i]=E[r_{\\text{target}}]\\), \\(\\sum_i w_i=1\\) and \\(w_i \\ge 0\\) for all assets \\(i\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontier with Short-Sale Constraints\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative to the GMV problem, the frontier problem contains an additional constraint of the form \\(Aw=b\\) in addition to the usual constraint that the portfolio is fulling invested.

    "text": "2.1 Portfolios of Two Risky Assets\nConsider forming a portfolio of two risky assets. To fix ideas, let’s consider these to be a US stock market fund and an international stock market fund. Unless otherwise stated, we will assume that portfolios are fully invested; that is, that the sum of the weights equal 1. If we invest all of our capital in some combination of these two assets, what are the expected returns and standard deviations of all the potential portfolios? Assume for now that we cannot short sell either asset; that is, the fraction invested in each must be non-negative.\nThe return of a two-asset portfolio is the weighted sum of the returns of the underlying assets: \\[ r_p = w  r_{\\text{US}} + (1-w) r_{\\text{intl}} \\,,  \\tag{2.1}\\] where \\(w\\) is the portfolio weight in the US stock fund. The expected return of the portfolio is: \\[ E[r_p] = w \\cdot  E[r_{\\text{US}}] + (1-w) E[r_{\\text{intl}}]\\,. \\tag{2.2}\\]\nWe will characterize the riskiness of portfolios using either variance or standard deviation. The portfolio return variance is a measure of dispersion or riskiness in the return distribution for the portfolio. It is defined as the expected (squared) magnitude of deviations in the portfolio return from its expected value: \\[ \\text{var}[r_p] = E\\big[(r_p-E[r_p])^2\\big]. \\tag{2.3}\\] As shown in the callout box, we can write the portfolio variance in terms of the individual asset variances and their covariance: \\[ w^2 \\text{var}[r_{\\text{US}}] + (1-w)^2 \\text{var}[r_{\\text{intl}}] + 2 w (1-w) \\text{cov}[r_{\\text{US}},r_{\\text{intl}}].  \\tag{2.4}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeriving two-asset portfolio variance\n\n\n\n\n\nTo derive Equation 2.4, first rewrite the portfolio return and expected return on the right-hand side of Equation 2.3 using Equation 2.1 and Equation 2.2 and group terms. Portfolio variance thus equals \\[ E\\big[\\left( w (r_{\\text{US}} - E[r_{\\text{US}}])+ (1-w) (r_{\\text{intl}}-E[r_{\\text{intl}}])\\right)^2\\big]. \\] Expanding the squared sum, we see that portfolio variance equals: \\[\\begin{align*}\n   &w^2 E\\big[(r_{\\text{US}}- E[r_{\\text{US}}])^2\\big] \\\\\n&+ (1-w)^2 E\\big[(r_{\\text{intl}}-E[r_{\\text{intl}}])^2\\big] \\\\\n&+ 2 w (1-w) E\\big[(r_{\\text{US}} - E[r_{\\text{US}}])(r_{\\text{intl}}-E[r_{\\text{intl}}])\\big].\n\\end{align*}\\] We arrive at Equation 2.4 by substituting in the definitions of variances of each asset and their covariance.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can express portfolio variance in terms of the individual asset risks and their correlation \\(\\rho\\): \\[ w^2 \\text{var}[r_{\\text{US}}] + (1-w)^2 \\text{var}[r_{\\text{intl}]} + 2 w (1-w) \\rho \\cdot \\text{sd}[r_{\\text{US}}]\\text{sd}[r_{\\text{intl}}] ,  \\tag{2.5}\\] where we used the fact that the covariance of two assets equals their correlation multiplied by the product of their standard deviations. The correlation between US stocks and stocks from developed international economies was about 75% over the last thirty years. Figure 2.1 plots the possible portfolios of the US and international stock funds. Investing in the US stock market fund alone is dominated by a combination of the two funds. It is possible to form a portfolio with less risk than investing 100% in the US fund. This is diversification in action. Moreover, these portfolios all have higher expected returns than does investing in the US fund alone.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 2.1: Portfolios of two risky assets\n\n\n\nDiversification benefits are greater when the assets are less correlated. This can be seen from visual inspection of Equation 2.5. The portfolio variance is lower for lower levels of the correlation between two assets. If two assets were perfectly negatively correlated, it would be possible to create a risk-free security; that is, we could diversify all risk from the portfolio.

It also has a correlation of about 75% with each of the other two funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating Portfolio Returns\n\n\n\n\n\nThe return of a portfolio combining \\(N\\) assets is simply the weighted average of the underlying asset returns: \\[ r_p = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i r_i\\,,  \\tag{2.6}\\] where the weights \\(\\{w_i\\}_{i=1}^N\\) are the fractions of capital invested in each asset.

Each of the blue dots represent a different possible combination of the three portfolios. The lines connecting pairs of the assets show all possible portfolios of investing just in those two assets. The diversification benefits of adding a third asset to any of the pairs of assets can be seen by the fact that many of the blue three-asset portfolios lie to the left of the two-asset frontiers. That is, adding a third asset can produce a portfolio with the same expected return but lower portfolio risk than can be achieved with just two assets.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 2.2: Portfolios of three risky assets\n\n\n\nFor example, consider an investor targeting a 6.5% return, the assumed expected return of the domestic international portfolio. If the investor is restricted to hold only a single asset, they must hold the domestic international fund with risk of over 16% per year. If an investor can hold two assets, they could lower the amount of risk by holding a portfolio of the US stock fund and the emerging market fund and reduce the portfolio risk to below 16% per year. An additional diversification benefit is possible if the investor holds all three assets; an even lower standard deviation can be achieved for the same expected return."

The first demonstrates entry element-by-element, and the second more elegantly (and concisely) uses matrix multiplication using the array of standard deviations and the correlation matrix.\nimport numpy as np\n\n##### Inputs\n# Standard deviations\nsds = np.array([0.20, 0.12, 0.15])\n\n# Correlations\ncorr12 = 0.3\ncorr13 = 0.3\ncorr23 = 0.3\n\n# Portfolio weights\nwgts = np.array([0.25, 0.5, 0.25])\n\n##### Method 1 to calculate covariance matrix\n# Covariances\ncov12 = corr12 * sds[0] * sds[1]\ncov13 = corr13 * sds[0] * sds[2]\ncov23 = corr23 * sds[1] * sds[2]\n# Covariance matrix\ncov = np.array([[sds[0]**2,  cov12,     cov13], \\\n                [cov12,      sds[1]**2, cov23], \\\n                [cov13,      cov23,     sds[2]**2]])\n\n##### Method 2 to calculate covariance matrix\n# Correlation matrix\nC  = np.identity(3)\nC[0, 1] = C[1, 0] = corr12\nC[0, 2] = C[2, 0] = corr13\nC[1, 2] = C[2, 1] = corr23\n# Covariance matrix\ncov = np.diag(sds) @ C @ np.diag(sds)\n\n##### Portfolio risk measures\n#Portfolio variance\nport_var = wgts @ cov @ wgts\n\n#Portfolio standard deviation\nport_sd  = np.sqrt(port_var)\n\n\n\nAverage correlation across assets is important for the possible diversification benefits in large portfolios. This is due to the sheer number of terms in the portfolio variance calculation Equation 2.8 involving correlations (through the covariance terms). We can visualize each term of the portfolio variance in matrix form. For instance, the three-asset version of Equation 2.8 in matrix form is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(w_1^2 \\text{var}[r_1]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_1 w_2 \\text{cov}[r_1,r_2]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_1 w_3 \\text{cov}[r_1,r_3]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(w_2 w_1 \\text{cov}[r_2,r_1]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_2^2 \\text{var}[r_2]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_2 w_3 \\text{cov}[r_2,r_3]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(w_3 w_1 \\text{cov}[r_3,r_1]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_3 w_2 \\text{cov}[r_3,r_2]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_3^2 \\text{var}[r_3]\\)\n\n\n\n\nFor the three-asset portfolio, there are 3 variance terms and 3 distinct covariance terms. For a five-asset portfolio, the tabular representation of Equation 2.8 is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(w_1^2 \\text{var}[r_1]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_1 w_2 \\text{cov}[r_1,r_2]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_1 w_3 \\text{cov}[r_1,r_3]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_1 w_4 \\text{cov}[r_1,r_4]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_1 w_5 \\text{cov}[r_1,r_5]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(w_2 w_1 \\text{cov}[r_2,r_1]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_2^2 \\text{var}[r_2]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_2 w_3 \\text{cov}[r_2,r_3]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_2 w_4 \\text{cov}[r_2,r_4]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_2 w_5 \\text{cov}[r_2,r_5]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(w_3 w_1 \\text{cov}[r_3,r_1]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_3 w_2 \\text{cov}[r_3,r_2]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_3^2 \\text{var}[r_3]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_3 w_4 \\text{cov}[r_3,r_4]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_3 w_5 \\text{cov}[r_3,r_5]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(w_4 w_1 \\text{cov}[r_4,r_1]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_4 w_2 \\text{cov}[r_4,r_2]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_4 w_3 \\text{cov}[r_4,r_3]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_4^2 \\text{var}[r_4]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_4 w_5 \\text{cov}[r_4,r_5]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(w_5 w_1 \\text{cov}[r_5,r_1]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_5 w_2 \\text{cov}[r_5,r_2]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_5 w_3 \\text{cov}[r_5,r_3]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_5 w_4 \\text{cov}[r_5,r_4]\\)\n\n\n\\(w_5^2 \\text{var}[r_5]\\)\n\n\n\n\nFor the five-asset portfolio, there are 5 variance terms (along the diagonal) and 10 =((25-5)/2) distinct covariance terms. For an \\(N\\) asset portfolio, there will be \\(N\\) variance terms and \\(\\frac{N^2-N}{2}\\) distinct covariance terms. For portfolios with many assets, the number of covariance terms will quickly dwarf the number of variance terms.\nTo see how correlation across assets can dominate the riskiness of individual securities in portfolios with many assets, consider an equally-weighted (\\(w_i=1/N\\) for all assets) portfolio where all assets have the same variance \\((\\sigma^2_{\\text{all}})\\) and all pairs of assets have the same covariance \\((\\overline{\\text{cov}})\\). The variance of this equal-weighted portfolio is the sum of the \\(N\\) variance terms and \\(N^2-N\\) covariance terms: \\[  N\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)^2 \\sigma^2_{\\text{all}} + (N^2-N)\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)^2 \\overline{\\text{cov}}\\,. \\] Simplifying, the portfolio variance is: \\[ \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right) \\sigma^2_{\\text{all}} + \\left(1-\\frac{1}{N}\\right) \\overline{\\text{cov}}\\,. \\] As the number of assets \\(N\\) gets very large, the portfolio variance approaches the common covariance across assets: \\[ \\text{var}(r_p) \\underset{N\\rightarrow \\infty}{\\longrightarrow} 0\\cdot\\sigma^2_{\\text{all}}+(1-0)\\overline{\\text{cov}}=\\overline{\\text{cov}}\\,. \\tag{2.10}\\]\nFigure 2.3 plots the portfolio variance for this equally-weighted portfolio as a function of the number of assets for three correlation values. The figure demonstrates three insights. First, as discussed previously, the diversification benefit is greater for lower levels of correlation across assets (that is, lower \\(\\overline{\\text{cov}}\\) here). Second, the marginal benefit of adding additional securities to a portfolio decreases with the number of securities. A large fraction of the overall risk reduction is due to the first 10 to 20 securities added to the portfolio. Third, there is a limit to risk reduction, and this limit is governed by the amount of common comovement across assets in the portfolio. \\(\\sigma_{\\text{all}}\\) is assumed to be 40%, so Equation 2.10 tells us that the portfolio standard deviation approaches values of 12.6%, 20%, and 28.3%, respectively, for correlations of 10%, 25%, and 50% as the number of portfolio assets gets large.1 Figure 2.3 shows that for portfolios of 200 assets, the portfolio standard deviation is already quite close to these limiting standard deviations.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 2.3: Portfolios of three risky assets"

    "text": "2.4 Short-Sales\nSo far, we have considered portfolios with nonnegative weights in each of the assets. Negative portfolio weights correspond to short positions in a portfolio. Short-selling involves borrowing a security from another owner and selling it. The short-seller then has a liability to return the security to the security lender; this liability is equal to the security’s market value. Short-sellers hope to purchase the security later for a lower price. Thus, they reverse the order of the investing maxim: buy low-sell high. Short-sellers hope to sell high-buy low. In practice, there are limitations on short selling: it may not be possible to use the proceeds from a short sale to buy other risky assets, less than full interest may be earned on the proceeds, and a fee must be paid to borrow the asset being shorted. In this section, we ignore those issues. We assume that proceeds from short sales are invested in the other risky assets.\nFigure 2.4 shows the expected returns and risks of portfolios of the US stock fund and the developed international fund when shorting is allowed. Comparing to Figure 2.1 above, allowing shorting expands the investment opportunity set to include expected return values below the US equity expected return and above the developed international fund expected return.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 2.4: Portfolios of two risky assets with shorting"

    "text": "2.5 The Efficient Frontier\nWith more than two risky assets, multiple portfolios can achieve the same expected return, but with different amounts of portfolio risk. This was seen above in Figure 2.2. All else equal, typical investors like expected return and dislike risk, so for a given expected return level, lower levels of portfolio standard deviation are preferred. For each level of expected return, we can find the portfolio that provides the highest possible diversification, that is, the lowest standard deviation. The set of these minimum-variance portfolios is called the frontier. The portfolio with the lowest standard deviation across all feasible expected returns is called the global minimum variance (GMV) portfolio. Portfolios that lie on the frontier with expected returns above those of the GMV portfolio are said to be efficient, and this portion of the frontier is called the efficient frontier. For the discussion below, we assume that short-sales are allowed. We will relax this assumption in a later chapter.\nMathematically, the GMV portfolio is the set of portfolio weights that minimizes portfolio variance without conditioning on the portfolio expected return: \\[ \\underset{w_1,w_2,\\dots,w_N}{\\text{min}} \\text{var}[r_p] \\tag{2.11}\\] subject to the constraints \\(\\sum_i w_i=1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating the GMV portfolio\n\n\n\n\n\nIf short sales are allowed, the GMV portfolio weights satisfy a system of equations.

    "text": "1.5 Loan payments\nThe payments on a loan are determined by the fact that the present value of the payments equals the amount borrowed (the loan principal). If the loan has level payments \\(P\\), then the loan principal \\(L\\) satisfies \\[L = P \\times \\text{AF} = \\frac{P}{r}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}\\right)\\,.\\] From this equation, we can calculate any of the loan parameters in terms of the others. Thus, we can answer any of the following questions:\n\n(\\(P\\)) I know how much I want to borrow, what the term of the loan will be, and what the rate will be. What will my payments be?\n(\\(L\\)) I know what the term of the loan will be and what the rate will be, and I know the payment that I can afford. How much can I borrow?\n(\\(r\\)) I know what the term of the loan will be, how much I want to borrow, and how much I can afford to pay. What rate do I need to get?\n\nThese are standard questions, and their answers – which are obtained by solving the above equation – are provided by online financial calculators and by the Excel and numpy-financial functions pmt, pv, and rate. See Section 1.10. For loans with monthly payments, we need to input the number of months as the number of periods and the monthly rate as the rate. For example, for a 30-year mortgage at a rate of 6%, we would input \\(30 \\times 12\\) as the number of periods and \\(0.06/12\\) as the rate.\nSometimes a loan will have a balloon payment, meaning an extra payment at the end to make up for the periodic payments being too small. The amount of any balloon \\(B\\) is determined by the equation \\[L = P \\times \\text{AF} + \\frac{B}{(1+r)^n}\\,.\\] This again reflects the fact that the present value of all payments equals the principal. The amount of a balloon payment can be calculated from the Excel and numpy-financial function fv.\nEach payment on a loan pays the interest that has accrued during the previous period plus something towards principal. As the principal is paid down, the interest decreases, so the payment towards principal increases. Tracking the principal over time is called creating an amortization table. Let’s create such a table. By doing so, we will also see why the present value of the payments equals the principal.\nADD AMORTIZATION TABLE"
