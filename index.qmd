# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a draft of a piece of a planned book about investments.  An innovative feature of the book is that it explains how to perform the calculations, data analysis, and simulations in python.  The last section of each chapter is devoted to python implementation of the concepts developed in the chapter.  The code is available here: [![](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bbcx-investments/code.git/HEAD).

The book is part of a twofold effort to enhance investments education.  The other piece is an interactive website [bbcx-investments.com](http://bbcx-investments.com/) that derives figures and tables from live data and user inputs to illustrate investments concepts.
